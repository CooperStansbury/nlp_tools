The skin sample will be cultured (which  means the skin cells are fed with nutrients in the lab to grow a certain type of cell called fibroblast cells  which lets us have a large supply of cells that can be used for research). Fibroblasts will be stored at the  Coriell repository, Camden, NJ with your consent. All identifiable information that will be collected about  you will be removed from the sample and replaced with a code. Fibroblasts will be available to Dr Kimonis  for her research studies.    Muscle biopsy:  Dr. Kreitenberg and/or Dr Kimonis at UCI Medical Center or the UCI GCRC will obtain the samples. The  muscle biopsy samples will be obtained in order to study the pathology of the disease. The samples will  be analyzed to learn how, on a molecular level, the disease leads to muscle weakness. We will use the  samples to identify the molecular pathways that are involved in the disease so that we may in the future  target certain proteins or molecules involved in these pathways to design therapies and treatments.     PROCEDURE:    Skin Biopsy: According to the UCI Department of Dermatology’s standard of care practice the area of  skin will be numbed with lidocaine injection. After 5 minutes the skin area will become numb.  The numb skin area will be cleaned with alcohol and a 3 mm skin sample will be obtained  using a standard punch biopsy needle. The sample of skin will be snipped at the base with a  sterile pair of scissors and placed in a tube containing a fluid that allows the cells to grow.  You may feel some discomfort when the skin sample is taken. The total amount of time for  the skin biopsy procedure is approximately 10 minutes for the actual procedure to be  performed. Bacitracin ointment will be applied to the biopsy site. The biopsy site should have  a clean application of bacitracin ointment and a clean bandage applied daily for three days.      YES____ NO____   Initial and date _____________________________    Muscle Biopsy: Muscle samples will be obtained from one of the leg or arm muscles through a muscle  biopsy. It may be obtained from the same site as the skin biopsy if applicable. A small  incision of ~1 cm will be made through the skin and muscle fascia (a layer of tissue  covering the muscle below the skin), and a stainless steel muscle biopsy needle will be  inserted. Muscle samples (2-3 cores) about the size of a pencil eraser will be obtained.   Following each biopsy, my incision will be closed with a tape strip and dressed with a  gauze pad and sterile surgical tape.  Ice will be applied to my incision area for 15  minutes, and my condition will be evaluated for any immediate complications such as  excessive bleeding. Wound evaluation will be performed at the UCI GCRC by registered  nurses.   This procedure should take approximately 30 minutes. The biopsy site should    Approved by IRB on: 09/11/2009 HS# 2007-5832 Void After: 09/10/2010      IRB USE ONLY - DO NOT ALTER THIS FOOTER        e-CPA# 5388       2 of 7  have a clean application of bacitracin ointment and a clean bandage applied daily for  three days.

You should not feel any pressure to participate. If  you do not want to participate it will not interfere with any current or future care you or your family  receives at this institution. If you are unable to participate or do not want to participate, another relative  will still be able to participate in this research study.  Subjects who choose not to participate in this skin  biopsy and/or the muscle biopsy portion of the study can still participate in the main study.      RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS:    The possible risks and/or discomforts associated with the procedures described in this study are minimal  or/and moderate. These are as follows:    Minimal risk for collection of a skin sample: At the time of collection of a 3 mm sample of skin, there will  be some discomfort from the skin biopsy punch insertion, and there is some possibility of bruising,  swelling, bleeding, and infection at the site of the scalpel punch insertion, also rarely of fainting. Please  inform Dr. Kimonis and your local physician if you experience pain or bleeding from this skin biopsy  procedure. The punch biopsy procedure may be somewhat painful. No stitches are required. The  resulting scar from the biopsy is tiny and does not cause problems. There may be some discomforts  associated with the lidocaine injection.    The muscle biopsy procedure should not cause you any long-term pain or lasting muscle damage.   However, any pain or discomfort you may feel following needle biopsy will be dealt with the application of  ice and administration of an analgesic agent. There is also a possibility that the biopsy site could become  infected. In the event complications arise pertaining to the muscle biopsy, the investigators will follow  proper medical procedures.  In all likelihood, you may develop small scars at the biopsy sites.    There is a reasonable possibility that no findings will result from this research effort. Any significant  findings that do result may take months or years to complete. If you wish to inquire into the progress of  our research, you are welcome to do so at any time.      BENEFITS:    You will not benefit directly from participation in this study. However, in the future, the information  obtained from this study may help researchers understand the genetic causes of the disease. This may  eventually lead to new forms of diagnosis and treatment in the future.    ALTERNATIVES TO PARTICIPATION:    If you choose not to participate in this portion of the study you can still participate in the main study.

PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY  2.1  Study purpose: The purpose of this study is to find out more about head and neck cancer and  learn better ways to treat these cancers or prevent cancer growth. We will be looking at the  molecular make-up of tumor cells which include genetics, proteomics and other biomarkers. We  believe that advances in the treatment and prevention of head and neck cancer will be based on  better understanding of specific molecular and genetic alterations typical of individual tumors.  We hope to identify traits that will distinguish which tumors can be treated most successfully by  surgery, and which tumors can be treated most successfully by chemotherapy or radiation, or by  the best combination. In order to study the genetics of these cancers, tumor tissue, tissue from  enlarged lymph nodes and nearby normal tissue, blood specimens, and fluids such as saliva  and/or nasal mucous membranes are needed for research tests to be done in our laboratories. By  targeting treatment approaches in this way, we hope to improve outcomes while minimizing  harmful effects of treatment. In addition, we will ask you about your health behaviors and any  other health conditions you may be experiencing. We want to see if these could also affect  cancer recurrence, survival, and quality of life.  We plan to study tissues, blood, saliva and/or mucous membranes from patients treated for a  head and neck tumor. We also plan to study serum and secretions from patients who do not have  a head and neck tumor(s) to serve as a comparison. In every surgical procedure, some tissue or  blood may be left over after surgery or biopsy is performed, and after all the usual diagnostic  tests have been done. This tissue or blood is often discarded or destroyed because it is not  needed for patient care. On the other hand, this tissue or blood may be donated for medical  research. The University of Michigan Health System (UMHS) and its investigators can learn  about disease from this tissue, blood and bodily fluids and these specimens can be used for future  research projects. We would like to obtain and store your samples for use in our studies aimed at  improving treatment regimens for head and neck cancer. Samples may be frozen and used for  future studies of genes associated with head and neck cancer. Proteomic and genomic studies  may also be performed on these samples. Samples may also be used to establish permanent cell  lines that can be studied in the future. Cell lines are permanent cultures of cells that we will  study for many years to come. Whole blood or serum or plasma obtained as part of routine  blood draws will also be used in the future to look for signs of cancer in a patient’s blood. Such  signs might be proteins or genetic material from the tumor that in the future may identify early  Consent Subtitle: __Umbrella  Page 2 of 12  Consent Version: _01/23/2013      Study ID: HUM00042189 IRB: IRBMED Date Approved: 2/11/2013 Expiration Date: 4/15/2013  cancers or cancer recurrence. Our Tissue Core will collect and store these tumor, blood, saliva  and mucus specimens for various studies to be conducted by researchers in our laboratories.  3. INFORMATION ABOUT STUDY PARTICIPANTS (SUBJECTS)  Taking part in this study is completely voluntary. You do not have to participate if you don't want to.  You may also leave the study at any time. If you leave the study before it is finished, there will be no penalty to you, and you will not lose any benefits to which you are otherwise entitled.  3.1 Who can take part in this study? Anyone undergoing treatment for a tumor of the head and  neck region can become a donor of tissue, blood, saliva and mucus. You will be eligible to participate if you are at least 18 years old and have a tumor of the head and neck region. You must sign this Informed  Consent document and have no barriers that would restrict your ability to understand or comply with all  procedures.  Normal healthy individuals may be asked to give a blood specimen or a saliva specimen or both.  Normal individuals who are undergoing elective surgery may be recruited from persons visiting our  ENT clinics for benign problems or from other normal persons who volunteer to give a specimen.  Note: it is very important for you to give the researchers accurate and complete  information about your medical history and condition.  3.2 How many people (subjects) are expected to take part in this study? We hope to enroll  a total of 3500 patients from the University of Michigan. Additionally we will enroll 500 patients from  the Karmanos Cancer Center in Detroit.  4. INFORMATION ABOUT STUDY PARTICIPATION  4.1 What will happen to me in this study? We would like to study tissue that is removed at the  time of surgical treatment or at the time of diagnostic biopsy. When we obtain tissue taken at the time  of biopsy, this will involve taking one or two extra pieces of tissue for research purposes. A biopsy is usually quite small – about the size of a pea. We may also harvest surplus biopsy specimens taken from  any enlarged neck lymph nodes. These biopsies would take place in the operating room as part of your  planned cancer surgery. An additional small biopsy of tissue next to your tumor may also be taken so  that comparisons between tumor and normal tissues can be made. A blood specimen will also be  obtained prior to treatment and blood samples may be obtained at approximately three-to-six month  intervals at your routine clinic visits up to two years after your treatment is finished. If your tumor  recurs, we would like to collect samples from the new tumor growth so that we can try to learn about  why the cancer grows back. Approximately one and a half ounces of blood (approximately 3  tablespoons) will be collected at each time point. We think that some markers might be detectable in  saliva or in rare cases in nasal secretions. You may be asked to spit into a cup to collect your saliva or the doctor may swab your nose to obtain nasal secretions. Before collecting this mucus we will spray a  mist of anesthetic into your nose. The first nasal sample would be collected while you are asleep in the operating room and subsequent samples would be collected when you return to the clinic after surgery.  We would like to have you complete a survey before you begin your treatment so we can assess certain  health behaviors such as smoking, alcohol use, sleep and physical activity. The survey will also ask  Consent Subtitle: __Umbrella  Page 3 of 12  Consent Version: _01/23/2013      Study ID: HUM00042189 IRB: IRBMED Date Approved: 2/11/2013 Expiration Date: 4/15/2013  about your feelings and aspects of quality of life. A research assistant will be available to help you if necessary. The survey will take approximately 20 to 30 minutes to complete. A week after you have  completed this survey we will mail you another survey about your diet for you to complete at home.  This additional survey will also take 20 to 30 minutes to complete. We may contact you by phone if we  need further information from you. You will also be asked to complete the same surveys at yearly  intervals for two years. If the funding of this study is extended, we may continue to mail you a yearly  follow-up survey for up to 10 years to get an update on how you are doing. Additionally we may ask  you to fill out shortened health behavior surveys (which take about 5 to 10 minutes to complete) every 3  to 6 months for 2 years in between these yearly updates. You will not be asked to make a separate visit  to the clinic for the administration of these surveys. They will be mailed to your home if you do not  have a scheduled appointment.  There is some new evidence that a small number of head and neck cancers �may be related to Human  Papilloma virus, which could be sexually transmitted. To better understand this process, we wish to  gather information about all head and neck cancer patients’ sexual history. If you agree to answer these questions, you will be asked to complete a brief questionnaire, which will take less than 5 minutes to  complete. The interviewer will give you the questionnaire in an envelope for your privacy. When you  have completed the questionnaire you will place it back in the envelope, seal it, and give it back to the study coordinator. These questions are important to ask because they may be related to the way cancer  develops. The information that you give to the interviewer will be kept confidential and will only be  seen by members of the study staff.  Answering these sensitive questions is voluntary. You may choose not to participate in the interview,  while still completing the other parts of this study. Please indicate below (by signing your initials) if you agree to complete the sexual history questionnaire.  Yes __________  No _________  We are requesting individuals without head and neck cancer to also provide one-time blood and/or  saliva samples so that we can compare the levels of markers in the blood or saliva of patients to those  that may be present in the blood of persons without head and neck tumors.  Once specimens have been collected, they will be processed and stored in our tissue bank. Some  samples may be frozen and used for future studies of genes associated with head and neck cancer.  Samples may also be used to establish permanent cell lines that can be studied in the future. Cell lines are permanent cultures of cells that we will study for many years to come. Our tissue bank will hold  these specimens until an investigator submits a request for specimens. Specimens are distributed only to members of our research team, or to other investigators who have secured IRB (ethics board) approval.  Specimens are distributed to outside investigators without any identifying information that would link a  specimen to an individual person. Some studies will use the biological specimens in genetic analysis  looking for molecular markers, genes, and/or proteins that may be used to predict response of specific  tumors to specific treatment options. You will not be told the results of any testing on your specimens.  Clinical data regarding your disease, treatment status, and response to therapy will be collected from  your medical record on an ongoing basis so that biological information that is learned from your  specimens can be linked to your response to therapy. We will learn about your treatment outcomes by  using your social security number; it will be kept in a private, secure UMHS file. Clinical data includes but are not limited to previous cancer history, social history (like use of tobacco and alcohol) the site and Consent Subtitle: __Umbrella  Page 4 of 12  Consent Version: _01/23/2013      Study ID: HUM00042189 IRB: IRBMED Date Approved: 2/11/2013 Expiration Date: 4/15/2013  stage of your tumor, treatment administered (like surgery, chemotherapy, radiation), pathology results,  and tumor response to these therapies (information about tumor growth, reduction in size, response, and  so forth). As with the specimens, these data will only be distributed to members of our research team or to outside investigators who have secured IRB (ethics board) approval or exemption.  You may be asked to complete a lifestyle questionnaire. The recruiter will ask about your  demographics, personal and family medical history, tobacco use, alcohol use, occupation history, sexual  history, and physical activity.  4.2 How much of my time will be needed to take part in this study?  Most subjects who participate in this study will have a diagnostic biopsy or surgery within one  month of their first visit to our department. Once a tumor specimen is obtained in the Operating  Room, we will request blood samples, saliva and/or mucus samples during your follow-up visits  up to two years after treatment is finished. If your tumor recurs, we would like to collect  samples from the new tumor growth so that we can try to learn about why the cancer grows back.  Collected tumor specimens, blood and saliva may be used in our laboratories for other molecular  studies of head and neck cancer in the future.  If you are asked to complete the health surveys, it will take approximately one hour to complete  the yearly surveys (30 minutes for health survey, 30 minutes for nutrition survey). These  surveys can be mailed to your home for you to complete. If you come in for any regularly  scheduled clinic appointments, we may approach you to fill out a shortened survey (5-10  minutes) and to have your blood drawn approximately every 3 to 6 months. You will not be  asked to make a separate visit to the clinic for collection of these blood, saliva and/or mucus  samples or surveys. If you do not have a regularly scheduled appointment at the University of  Michigan, we will mail the short 5-10 minute update surveys to your home for you to complete.  If you are asked to complete the lifestyle questionnaire, it will take about 30 minutes to  complete.  4.3 When will my participation in the study be over?  Cancer patients will be followed for life, while normal subject participation is complete once specimens  and initial clinical data are procured. Data analysis will continue for the duration of the study. Survey collection will occur for up to 10 years so we can get an update on how you are doing.  5. INFORMATION ABOUT RISKS AND BENEFITS  5.1 What risks will I face by taking part in the study? What will the researchers do to  protect me against these risks?  There are few foreseeable risks to you from participating in this study. There are inconveniences  such as giving blood, or minor risks such as bruising, lightheadedness or fainting from blood  sample collection. There is a potential but small risk of bleeding or discomfort or localized  Consent Subtitle: __Umbrella  Page 5 of 12  Consent Version: _01/23/2013      Study ID: HUM00042189 IRB: IRBMED Date Approved: 2/11/2013 Expiration Date: 4/15/2013  infection from biopsies. We will work to reduce these risks by having only experienced people  perform blood drawing and only experienced surgeons perform biopsies.  There is a small risk that when more than one biopsy is taken that there is a greater risk of pain  or bleeding. There is also a risk that the biopsy sent to Pathology for diagnosis will not contain  adequate tissue for diagnosis. This risk is also present when only one diagnostic biopsy is taken.  To safeguard against the possibility of inadequate diagnosis, we will store the research sample in  our freezer until the diagnosis is made. If there is a problem with the sample sent for diagnosis,  we will submit the research sample to Pathology for diagnostic analysis.  Taking part in more than one research project can be risky. Please let us know if you are  participating in another study so that we can determine if there is a risk. Since this study does  not involve treatment or drugs, it is unlikely that participating in this and another study will  cause you increased risk. However, it is still important to disclose any other study in which you  are participating.  It is possible that some of the survey questions might upset you. However, you may choose not  to answer any question that upsets you. If at any time you feel upset by the questions asked, a  trained researcher would be available to talk with you by phone. There is a potential risk of loss  or breach of confidentiality; however, patient confidentiality is a priority and we work hard to  keep your personal and medical information private. See section 9 below for more information.  As with any research study, there may be additional risks that are unknown or unexpected.  5.2 What happens if I get hurt, become sick, or have other problems as a result of this  research?  The researchers have taken steps to minimize the risks of this study. Even so, you may still have  problems or side effects, even when the researchers are careful to avoid them. Please tell the researchers listed in Section 10 about any injuries, side effects, or other problems that you have during this study.  You should also tell your regular doctors.  5.3 If I take part in this study, can I also participate in other studies?  Being in more than one research study at the same time, or even at different times, may increase the risks to you. It may also affect the results of the studies. You should not take part in more than one study without approval from the researchers involved in each study.  5.4 How could I benefit if I take part in this study? How could others benefit?  There will be no direct medical benefit to you as a result of donating your tissue or blood samples. The benefits are more likely to affect future individuals diagnosed with cancers of the head and neck region, as markers useful for monitoring tumor relapse or genetic markers that influence tumor behavior are  discovered. These markers can then be used to develop tailored treatment regimens that improve  outcome while minimizing side effects of treatment.

more about head and neck cancer and learn better ways to treat these cancers or prevent cancer growth. we will be looking at the molecular make-up of tumor cells which include genetics, proteomics and other biomarkers. we believe that advances in the treatment and prevention of head and neck cancer will be based on better understanding of specific molecular and genetic alterations typical of individual tumors. we hope to identify traits that will distinguish which tumors can be treated most successfully by surgery, and which tumors can be treated most successfully by chemotherapy or radiation, or by the best combination. in order to study the genetics of these cancers, tumor tissue, tissue from enlarged lymph nodes and nearby normal tissue, blood specimens, and fluids such as saliva and/or nasal mucous membranes are needed for research tests to be done in our laboratories. by targeting treatment approaches in this way, we hope to improve outcomes while minimizing harmful effects of treatment. in addition, we will ask you about your health behaviors and any other health conditions you may be experiencing. we want to see if these could also affect cancer recurrence, survival, and quality of life. we plan to study tissues, blood, saliva and/or mucous membranes from patients treated for a head and neck tumor. we also plan to study serum and secretions from patients who do not have a head and neck tumor(s) to serve as a comparison. in every surgical procedure, some tissue or blood may be left over after surgery or biopsy is performed, and after all the usual diagnostic tests have been done. this tissue or blood is often discarded or destroyed because it is not needed for patient care. on the other hand, this tissue or blood may be donated for medical research. the university of michigan health system (umhs) and its investigators can learn about disease from this tissue, blood and bodily fluids and these specimens can be used for future research projects. we would like to obtain and store your samples for use in our studies aimed at improving treatment regimens for head and neck cancer. samples may be frozen and used for future studies of genes associated with head and neck cancer. proteomic and genomic studies may also be performed on these samples. samples may also be used to establish permanent cell lines that can be studied in the future. cell lines are permanent cultures of cells that we will study for many years to come. whole blood or serum or plasma obtained as part of routine blood draws will also be used in the future to look for signs of cancer in a patient s blood. such signs might be proteins or genetic material from the tumor that in the future may identify early consent subtitle: umbrella page 2 of 12 consent version: 01/23/2013 study id: hum00042189 irb: irbmed date approved: 2/11/2013 expiration date: 4/15/2013 cancers or cancer recurrence. our tissue core will collect and store these tumor, blood, saliva and mucus specimens for various studies to be conducted by researchers in our laboratories. 3. information about study participants (subjects) taking part in this study is completely voluntary. you do not have to participate if you don't want to. you may also leave the study at any time. if you leave the study before it is finished, there will be no penalty to you, and you will not lose any benefits to which you are otherwise entitled. 3.1 who can take part in this study anyone undergoing treatment for a tumor of the head and neck region can become a donor of tissue, blood, saliva and mucus. you will be eligible to participate if you are at least 18 years old and have a tumor of the head and neck region. you must sign this informed consent document and have no barriers that would restrict your ability to understand or comply with all procedures. normal healthy individuals may be asked to give a blood specimen or a saliva specimen or both. normal individuals who are undergoing elective surgery may be recruited from persons visiting our ent clinics for benign problems or from other normal persons who volunteer to give a specimen. note: it is very important for you to give the researchers accurate and complete information about your medical history and condition. 3.2 how many people (subjects) are expected to take part in this study we hope to enroll a total of 3500 patients from the university of michigan. additionally we will enroll 500 patients from the karmanos cancer center in detroit. 4. information about study participation 4.1 what will happen to me in this study we would like to study tissue that is removed at the time of surgical treatment or at the time of diagnostic biopsy. when we obtain tissue taken at the time of biopsy, this will involve taking one or two extra pieces of tissue for research purposes. a biopsy is usually quite small about the size of a pea. we may also harvest surplus biopsy specimens taken from any enlarged neck lymph nodes. these biopsies would take place in the operating room as part of your planned cancer surgery. an additional small biopsy of tissue next to your tumor may also be taken so that comparisons between tumor and normal tissues can be made. a blood specimen will also be obtained prior to treatment and blood samples may be obtained at approximately three-to-six month intervals at your routine clinic visits up to two years after your treatment is finished. if your tumor recurs, we would like to collect samples from the new tumor growth so that we can try to learn about why the cancer grows back. approximately one and a half ounces of blood (approximately 3 tablespoons) will be collected at each time point. we think that some markers might be detectable in saliva or in rare cases in nasal secretions. you may be asked to spit into a cup to collect your saliva or the doctor may swab your nose to obtain nasal secretions. before collecting this mucus we will spray a mist of anesthetic into your nose. the first nasal sample would be collected while you are asleep in the operating room and subsequent samples would be collected when you return to the clinic after surgery. we would like to have you complete a survey before you begin your treatment so we can assess certain health behaviors such as smoking, alcohol use, sleep and physical activity. the survey will also ask consent subtitle: umbrella page 3 of 12 consent version: 01/23/2013 study id: hum00042189 irb: irbmed date approved: 2/11/2013 expiration date: 4/15/2013 about your feelings and aspects of quality of life. a research assistant will be available to help you if necessary. the survey will take approximately 20 to 30 minutes to complete. a week after you have completed this survey we will mail you another survey about your diet for you to complete at home. this additional survey will also take 20 to 30 minutes to complete. we may contact you by phone if we need further information from you. you will also be asked to complete the same surveys at yearly intervals for two years. if the funding of this study is extended, we may continue to mail you a yearly follow-up survey for up to 10 years to get an update on how you are doing. additionally we may ask you to fill out shortened health behavior surveys (which take about 5 to 10 minutes to complete) every 3 to 6 months for 2 years in between these yearly updates. you will not be asked to make a separate visit to the clinic for the administration of these surveys. they will be mailed to your home if you do not have a scheduled appointment. there is some new evidence that a small number of head and neck cancers may be related to human papilloma virus, which could be sexually transmitted. to better understand this process, we wish to gather information about all head and neck cancer patients sexual history. if you agree to answer these questions, you will be asked to complete a brief questionnaire, which will take less than 5 minutes to complete. the interviewer will give you the questionnaire in an envelope for your privacy. when you have completed the questionnaire you will place it back in the envelope, seal it, and give it back to the study coordinator. these questions are important to ask because they may be related to the way cancer develops. the information that you give to the interviewer will be kept confidential and will only be seen by members of the study staff. answering these sensitive questions is voluntary. you may choose not to participate in the interview, while still completing the other parts of this study. please indicate below (by signing your initials) if you agree to complete the sexual history questionnaire. yes  no  we are requesting individuals without head and neck cancer to also provide one-time blood and/or saliva samples so that we can compare the levels of markers in the blood or saliva of patients to those that may be present in the blood of persons without head and neck tumors. once specimens have been collected, they will be processed and stored in our tissue bank. some samples may be frozen and used for future studies of genes associated with head and neck cancer. samples may also be used to establish permanent cell lines that can be studied in the future. cell lines are permanent cultures of cells that we will study for many years to come. our tissue bank will hold these specimens until an investigator submits a request for specimens. specimens are distributed only to members of our research team, or to other investigators who have secured irb (ethics board) approval. specimens are distributed to outside investigators without any identifying information that would link a specimen to an individual person. some studies will use the biological specimens in genetic analysis looking for molecular markers, genes, and/or proteins that may be used to predict response of specific tumors to specific treatment options. you will not be told the results of any testing on your specimens. clinical data regarding your disease, treatment status, and response to therapy will be collected from your medical record on an ongoing basis so that biological information that is learned from your specimens can be linked to your response to therapy. we will learn about your treatment outcomes by using your social security number; it will be kept in a private, secure umhs file. clinical data includes but are not limited to previous cancer history, social history (like use of tobacco and alcohol) the site and consent subtitle: umbrella page 4 of 12 consent version: 01/23/2013 study id: hum00042189 irb: irbmed date approved: 2/11/2013 expiration date: 4/15/2013 stage of your tumor, treatment administered (like surgery, chemotherapy, radiation), pathology results, and tumor response to these therapies (information about tumor growth, reduction in size, response, and so forth). as with the specimens, these data will only be distributed to members of our research team or to outside investigators who have secured irb (ethics board) approval or exemption. you may be asked to complete a lifestyle questionnaire. the recruiter will ask about your demographics, personal and family medical history, tobacco use, alcohol use, occupation history, sexual history, and physical activity. 4.2 how much of my time will be needed to take part in this study most subjects who participate in this study will have a diagnostic biopsy or surgery within one month of their first visit to our department. once a tumor specimen is obtained in the operating room, we will request blood samples, saliva and/or mucus samples during your follow-up visits up to two years after treatment is finished. if your tumor recurs, we would like to collect samples from the new tumor growth so that we can try to learn about why the cancer grows back. collected tumor specimens, blood and saliva may be used in our laboratories for other molecular studies of head and neck cancer in the future. if you are asked to complete the health surveys, it will take approximately one hour to complete the yearly surveys (30 minutes for health survey, 30 minutes for nutrition survey). these surveys can be mailed to your home for you to complete. if you come in for any regularly scheduled clinic appointments, we may approach you to fill out a shortened survey (5-10 minutes) and to have your blood drawn approximately every 3 to 6 months. you will not be asked to make a separate visit to the clinic for collection of these blood, saliva and/or mucus samples or surveys. if you do not have a regularly scheduled appointment at the university of michigan, we will mail the short 5-10 minute update surveys to your home for you to complete. if you are asked to complete the lifestyle questionnaire, it will take about 30 minutes to complete. 4.3 when will my participation in the study be over cancer patients will be followed for life, while normal subject participation is complete once specimens and initial clinical data are procured. data analysis will continue for the duration of the study. survey collection will occur for up to 10 years so we can get an update on how you are doing. 5. information about risks and benefits 5.1 what risks will i face by taking part in the study what will the researchers do to protect me against these risks there are few foreseeable risks to you from participating in this study. there are inconveniences such as giving blood, or minor risks such as bruising, lightheadedness or fainting from blood sample collection. there is a potential but small risk of bleeding or discomfort or localized consent subtitle: umbrella page 5 of 12 consent version: 01/23/2013 study id: hum00042189 irb: irbmed date approved: 2/11/2013 expiration date: 4/15/2013 infection from biopsies. we will work to reduce these risks by having only experienced people perform blood drawing and only experienced surgeons perform biopsies. there is a small risk that when more than one biopsy is taken that there is a greater risk of pain or bleeding. there is also a risk that the biopsy sent to pathology for diagnosis will not contain adequate tissue for diagnosis. this risk is also present when only one diagnostic biopsy is taken. to safeguard against the possibility of inadequate diagnosis, we will store the research sample in our freezer until the diagnosis is made. if there is a problem with the sample sent for diagnosis, we will submit the research sample to pathology for diagnostic analysis. taking part in more than one research project can be risky. please let us know if you are participating in another study so that we can determine if there is a risk. since this study does not involve treatment or drugs, it is unlikely that participating in this and another study will cause you increased risk. however, it is still important to disclose any other study in which you are participating. it is possible that some of the survey questions might upset you. however, you may choose not to answer any question that upsets you. if at any time you feel upset by the questions asked, a trained researcher would be available to talk with you by phone. there is a potential risk of loss or breach of confidentiality; however, patient confidentiality is a priority and we work hard to keep your personal and medical information private. see section 9 below for more information. as with any research study, there may be additional risks that are unknown or unexpected. 5.2 what happens if i get hurt, become sick, or have other problems as a result of this research the researchers have taken steps to minimize the risks of this study. even so, you may still have problems or side effects, even when the researchers are careful to avoid them. please tell the researchers listed in section 10 about any injuries, side effects, or other problems that you have during this study. you should also tell your regular doctors. 5.3 if i take part in this study, can i also participate in other studies being in more than one research study at the same time, or even at different times, may increase the risks to you. it may also affect the results of the studies. you should not take part in more than one study without approval from the researchers involved in each study. 5.4 how could i benefit if i take part in this study how could others benefit there will be no direct medical benefit to you as a result of donating your tissue or blood samples. the benefits are more likely to affect future individuals diagnosed with cancers of the head and neck region, as markers useful for monitoring tumor relapse or genetic markers that influence tumor behavior are discovered. these markers can then be used to develop tailored treatment regimens that improve outcome while minimizing side effects of treatment. consent subtitle: umbrella page 6 of 12 consent version: 01/23/2013 study id:

study, it is possible that you may be asked to sign a new consent form that includes the new information. 6. other options 6.1 if i decide not to take part in this study, what other options do i have you may decide not to participate in this study. your decision will not affect your medical treatment in any way. 7. ending the study 7.1 if i want to stop participating in the study, what should i do you are free to leave the study at any time. if you leave the study before it is finished, there will be no penalty to you. you will not lose any benefits to which you may otherwise be entitled. if you choose to tell the researchers why you are leaving the study, your reasons for leaving may be kept as part of the study record. if you decide to leave the study before it is finished, please tell one of the persons listed in section 10 contact information (below). patients can withdraw participation in studies analyzing biologic specimen by documented verbal or written notification. this withdrawal will be communicated to the respective specimen repository and any un-used specimens will be disposed of. however, once specimens have been used for analysis, it is not possible to withdraw them for disposal. 7.2 could there be any harm to me if i decide to leave the study before it is finished there is no harm to you if you decide to leave the study. you can withdraw from this study at any time without loss of any non-study related benefits to which you would have been entitled before participating in the study. if you want to withdraw, you may do so by notifying the study representative listed in the contact information section below. 7.3 could the researchers take me out of the study even if i want to continue to participate yes. there are many reasons why the researchers may need to end your participation in the study. some examples are: consent subtitle: umbrella page 7 of 12 consent version: 01/23/2013 study id: hum00042189 irb: irbmed date approved:

institutional policy. we shall not allow anyone to see your record other than people who have a right to see it. you will not be individually identified in any reports of this study. in order to understand the significance of the research done on your tissue, researchers may need to know some things about you. for example, your gender, your age, your health history and your family history. the information from your medical records will be given to approved researchers by the tissue bank records staff. information that directly identifies you will not be shared with investigators other than those involved in this study. investigators involved in this program will be able to withdraw specimens or data from the tissue repository as required by their individual projects. investigators not involved in this program must secure an appropriate institutional review board (ethics board) approval in order to be permitted access to specimens; bar-coded specimens will be distributed and any data provided will have all personal identifying information removed. 9.2 what information about me could be seen by the researchers or by other people why who might see it signing this form gives the researchers your permission to obtain, use, and share information about you for this study, and is required in order for you to take part in the study. information about you may be obtained from any hospital, doctor, and other health care provider involved in your care, including: hospital/doctor's office records, including test results (x-rays, blood tests, urine tests, etc.) all records relating to your condition, the treatment you have received, and your response to the treatment there are many reasons why information about you may be used or seen by the researchers or others during or after this study. examples include: the researchers may need the information to make sure you can take part in the study. university, food and drug administration (fda), and/or other government officials may need the information to make sure that the study is done in a safe and proper manner. study sponsors or funders, or safety monitors or committees, may need the information to: o make

The nature of the test and how it will be performed.   What is the Columbia Combined Genetic Panel (CCGP)?   The Columbia Combined Panel is a genetic test that evaluates changes in your child’s DNA that might be the  cause of your child’s clinical condition.  A gene is an individual unit of DNA. Exons are the most important regions of  the gene that provide the instructions for the body to make proteins and chemicals that allow it to function properly.   Changes in genes, called mutations, can lead to disease. The Columbia Combined Panel tests for exons of many  genes at the same time. The genes are chosen based on their known role in diseases that cause symptoms similar to  your child’s symptoms. Because this test examines a larger portion of the genetic material than traditional tests, it  might discover the cause of disease in cases where other tests were inconclusive. Because the Columbia Combined  Panel is more complicated than prior genetic testing your child may have had, the consent and ordering process must  be thorough and will be done with the assistance of a genetic counselor and/or your doctor.   How is the test done?    Two tubes (two teaspoons) of blood will be collected from your child.  Based on your family tree, your genetic  counselor or doctor may also recommend that blood be drawn from two or more members of your family, such as the  child’s father or siblings, to help with interpretation of test results.  The genes tested by the CCGP are part of the  DNA in your child’s blood cells. DNA from your child’s blood is purified, and the exome sequence is obtained (or  “read”) using high throughput sequencing. The sequence obtained for the genes included in the CCGP is then  searched for changes that are known or suspected to cause disease.   How is this test interpreted?   Once the DNA sequence of the exons of the genes of interest is read, the information obtained is analyzed  for differences between your child’s sequence and a reference (“normal) sequence.  Everyone has places in their  sequence that are different from the reference. These differences make us unique and usually do not cause medical  problems.  To determine whether the changes that are found are neutral, or can cause disease, the following steps  are taken:  First, the variations in your child’s sequence will be compared with a list of mutations that are known to cause  medical problems in other people with symptoms similar to those seen in your child. Subsequently one will examine  whether disruptive mutations not previously described are present in genes that are known to cause the type of  disease your child has. Changes found will be compared to the changes seen in your selected family members with  or without the disease (if available) to confirm that the changes are indeed the cause of your child’s disease.     2. The Primary Purpose of the test (why it is being performed).   The test is being performed primarily to detect a genetic cause for your child’s condition. The condition is   _____________________, which causes _______________________________________.    The test results may be complex, so you must obtain genetic counseling before signing  this consent.     th Personalized Genomic Medicine Laboratory  630 West 168  Street  Department of Pathology and Cell Biology  P&S17-401  www.pathology.columbia.edu  New York, NY 10032    Tel: 212-305-9706  OFFICE USE    Fax: 212-342-0420   ONLY:   WGS sequencing reviewed:  Lab Acc. #:__________      3. What kinds of results may be obtained, what is their significance for health, and what  should you do after receiving the results?    What kind of results may be reported?  There are several different kinds of results that may be reported. All results will go directly to the healthcare  provider who ordered the test.  1. Positive for disease-causing mutation(s): Your child may have one or more mutations that are known to  cause a specific genetic condition in other individuals with symptoms similar to your child’s symptoms.   These mutations are interpreted as the cause of your child’s symptoms.  2. No disease causing mutations or variants found: It is possible that the test will not find any genetic  change that would explain your child’s symptoms.  This type of test result does not mean your child’s  condition is not genetic. The result would not take away whatever symptoms or current diagnoses  doctors may have given your child.  3. Variant with uncertain significance: Sometimes the test will find a genetic variation that is predicted to be  important, but has not been reported or seen before in people with your child’s condition.  Such a variant  may or may not be causing your child’s symptoms, but the lab will report it as a “variant of uncertain  significance” if there is evidence strongly suggesting that it is related to your child’s condition.    Are there any types of results that will not be given to me?  Yes, there are a few types of results that will not be included in the report your child’s doctor gets.   1. Mutations that are not directly related to your child’s condition (incidental findings) will not be reported.  2. We might use your relatives’ samples to help us diagnose your child’s condition, but we will not report  results for these individuals. However, your child’s genetic results might have implications for your  relatives. It is important that you discuss these implications with your genetic counselor.  3. The DNA that will be tested on the sequencer will include genes that are not related to your child’s  condition.  We will NOT analyze these genes. Therefore, results for these genes will NOT be available to  you OR us, and will not be reported. IF your doctor decides to test for the other genes in our large panel  of genes, he/she will have to order another test.     What should I do if there is a positive result?               This is a test to identify a genetic cause of your child’s clinical condition. If the test is positive for a genetic  cause of your child’s clinical condition, you may wish to consult your physician or have further genetic counseling or  undergo further independent testing.  ____ (Initial) I understand that I have the option to seek further independent testing, and that I should obtain genetic  counseling to help me understand the results.       th Personalized Genomic Medicine Laboratory  630 West 168  Street  Department of Pathology and Cell Biology  P&S17-401  www.pathology.columbia.edu  New York, NY 10032    Tel: 212-305-9706  OFFICE USE    Fax: 212-342-0420   ONLY:   WGS sequencing reviewed:  Lab Acc. #:__________      Are there limitations to the testing?  Yes, there are several limitations to the Columbia Combined Genetic Panel:  1. The test is not able to detect mutations in genes that are not known to be associated with the symptoms  that your child has.  2. The test report is generated based on current medical knowledge. A mutation that is not known to be the  cause of a genetic condition today, may be shown to be disease-causing in a year or two.  We do not  generate updated reports for the test, unless we are requested to do so by the patient. There is a fee  associated with providing an updated report.   3. The test is not currently validated to detect large-scale alterations in the DNA content of the patient’s  cells.  These include losses or duplications of many genes.  Another genetic test called a microarray is  available for this purpose.  It might be ordered by your child’s physician before the CCGP testing.  4. The test may not be able detect genetic disorders that are caused by expansion of repetitive regions of  the genome. One example is Fragile X syndrome.  If one of these conditions is suspected, your child’s  physician should order the appropriate test.  5. The test is not able to detect mutations in the part of the DNA that is not part of the exons, (the coding  portion of the gene), such as parts of the DNA that help regulate gene function.   6. The test may detect findings of uncertain significance, which cannot be proven with complete certainty to  be the cause of your child’s condition (see types of results described above).  7. Finding a disease-causing mutation may not result in a treatment, cure, or a prognosis (knowledge about  the way a disease is expected to progress).  8. Standard lab limitations caused by human error, such as sample contamination or sample mix-up, may  occur but are unlikely.  ____ (Initial) I understand the limitations to CCGP  4. When DNA testing detects the most common disease-causing changes in a gene, the  test result is highly accurate.    5. Implications of positive and negative results for your diagnosis  Predicting the results of CCGP in advance is not possible. Predicting in advance what the results will mean for your  child’s health is also not possible. This is due to the fact that many genes are tested and many different positive  results can be obtained. Each of these different results will have potentially different implications.  A negative result  (not finding mutations responsible for your child’s disease) will not change your child’s diagnosis.      6. Who will have access to the results?   The results of the CCGP become a part of the patient’s medical record. Test results are stored in the laboratory’s  computer records, and are normally automatically sent to computerized medical records of New York Presbyterian  Hospital and Columbia University. If you do not want these results to be sent to these records, you must inform us  about this. Unless you tell us not to transmit them, the results will become part of the patient’s electronic medical  record. Even if they do not become part of the electronic medical record, the results may be made available to  individuals/organizations with legal access to the patient’s medical record, on a strict “need-to-know” basis.  Those  with legal access include, but are not limited to the physicians and nursing staff directly involved in the patient’s care,   th Personalized Genomic Medicine Laboratory  630 West 168  Street  Department of Pathology and Cell Biology  P&S17-401  www.pathology.columbia.edu  New York, NY 10032    Tel: 212-305-9706  OFFICE USE    Fax: 212-342-0420   ONLY:   WGS sequencing reviewed:  Lab Acc. #:__________      the patient’s current and future insurance carriers, after consent is obtained, and others specifically authorized by you  or your authorized representative to gain access to your child’s medical records.  ____ __(Initial) I understand, that the results will be automatically transmitted to the patient’s electronic medical  records in the NYPH and Columbia University EMRs, and I do not object to this.   _______(Initial) Please do not transmit any of the results to the Hospital’s electronic medical records. I  understand that the results will continue to be part of the laboratory’s electronic information system.  If the  results are not entered in the Hospital or University’s electronic medical records, future physicians may not  have access to those results.  I understand I must assume responsibility for informing my child’s future  physicians of these results, or for requesting that physicians contact the Columbia University Personalized  Genomic Medicine Laboratory for these.       7. How long are the CCGP results kept in the testing lab?  The laboratory will keep the identified CCGP raw data for 5 years.  The final report will be kept as long as  possible, but at least 5 years.  After this, the data from which the final report was generated will be de-identified, and  will be stored in a database that does not include any names or other information that would link them back to your  child.  However, information about the type of disease and the type of symptoms associated with the genetic findings  will be preserved.  Because this is a new test, it is important to keep track of the types of variants and mutations that  are being found to help us improve our diagnostic capabilities. Although your child would not directly benefit from this,  others with similar conditions would. Please indicate your choice below.  ____ (Initial) I agree to the CCGP data being stored indefinitely in a de-identified way.  ____ (Initial) I do not want CCGP data being stored indefinitely even if it is de-identified.    8. Statement that no additional tests will be performed on this sample, without specific,  signed authorization by the patient/legal representative, and that after 60 days, unless  consent is given, the sample will be destroyed.  How long are the samples kept in the lab?  Blood and DNA samples are normally discarded after 60 days, following test completion, unless you provide  us consent to store the DNA after testing is performed.  Storing your child’s sample may allow you to request testing  in the future without having to obtain a new sample, or to participate in future research, should you wish to do so.  If  you would like the DNA to be stored after your child reaches the age of 18, the adult child (or legal representative) will  have to request that the DNA continue to be stored after that period.    ____ (Initial) Please keep DNA used in testing my child indefinitely for future testing should I desire such testing, or  should I want to participate in research in the future. I understand no additional genetic tests will be performed  without my specific consent/instructions.  If I decide to participate in research in the future, I will instruct the  laboratory, and there will be a requirement of a separate IRB-approved consent.  The DNA may be used only for   th Personalized Genomic Medicine Laboratory  630 West 168  Street  Department of Pathology and Cell Biology  P&S17-401  www.pathology.columbia.edu  New York, NY 10032    Tel: 212-305-9706  OFFICE USE    Fax: 212-342-0420   ONLY:   WGS sequencing reviewed:  Lab Acc. #:__________      quality control purposes, and I understand that there is no guarantee of its availability after 60 days.  ____ (Initial) Do not keep DNA used in testing my child associated with information that could identify my child, but  you may use my child’s de-identified DNA for quality control purposes or for research in which the identity cannot be  traced back to my child or my family. I understand that any research using the de-identified DNA will require a  specific IRB approval and oversight.   ____ (Initial) Please discard DNA and other biologic materials used in testing my child 60 days after all testing is  completed.   9. What are the risks of testing?   1. Identification of familial relationships: CCGP may identify familial relationships other than those originally  reported.  For example, non-paternity (when the reported father of the child is not the biological father) or  half sibling-ships (when siblings do not share the same father AND mother) would be detected. You may  choose whether or not to be informed of this information, in case it is revealed during the testing.     2. Discrimination. The genetic non-discrimination law prevents insurance companies from using your child’s  genetic information to deny health insurance coverage. However, the law does not cover life insurance,  disability insurance or long term care insurance. The detection of an incidental condition may affect your  child’s future ability to buy these forms of insurance or get the best insurance rates. By New York State  Law, your consent is required for the release of these results to insurance companies. However, you may  be required to release this information to the insurance companies for your contract with them to be valid.     3. Requirement for further testing: CCGP may identify genetic changes that may require additional testing  to evaluate.  This could result in anxiety, uncertainty, and additional expenses that may or may not be  covered by your insurance.     4. Detection of untreatable conditions. CCGP may identify serious, untreatable genetic conditions. It can  result in unexpected psychological trauma, both for you and your family. The detection of such a  condition could also affect the health or health care needs of your child’s siblings, or other close relatives.     10. Statement of Financial responsibility  ____ (Initial) I understand that I, having requested testing to be performed, am responsible for the cost of this testing  and will be required to pay for any/all of the test cost if health insurance does not reimburse the laboratory.

sequencing tests for genetic disorders offered  by the Personalized Genomic Medicine Laboratory of Columbia University  Medical Center     Overview   The human genome contains in excess of 20000 protein coding genes. In a  constantly updated encyclopedia of mendelian human disorders, OMIM, as of October 16,  2012, there are about 3600 phenotypes described in which the molecular basis of the  disease is known. There is also an additional 3600 phenotypes listed that have no known  molecular basis to date.  The number of genes described on the site is past 14,000, and  all these genes are thought to be relevant to human disease, although maybe only half of  them have a confirmed role in one or more genetic disorders.    The current paradigm for genetic diagnosis rests on PCR and microarray-based  detection of specific mutations of known significance and/or Sanger sequencing that  allows detection of previously described, as well as novel mutations, in genes that have  been well established to play a role in a specific disease.  These methods work well for  screening for specific mutations or for demonstration of mutations in a small number of  genes, if the gene(s) to test can be largely ascertained based on the clinical phenotype.   However, they fall short in cases where the phenotype and genotype correlation is not  strong enough to efficiently guide the decision-making process as to what mutation in  which gene should be tested for. In cases like congenital hearing loss in which over 100  loci have been implicated, it is often impossible to establish in what order to perform the  review of genes linked to the phenotype.  Even if a more logical phenotype based  approach is available, like in the case of muscular dystrophies, the diagnostic odyssey is  often too painful and expensive to undertake.  Since genetic information is changing at a  rapid pace, clinicians may be unaware of all known genes and, therefore, fail to order the  appropriate tests. NGS allows for simultaneous sequencing of large number of genes that  might carry mutations causing the symptoms of a patient at an affordable price. This  prevents individual clinician bias in testing decisions and improves diagnostic success  rate.    We offer four clinical NGS tests at the Personalized Genomic Medicine Laboratories at  Columbia University Medical Center. These are full mitochondrial genome sequencing  (MGS), the Columbia Combined Genetic Panel (CCGP), whole exome sequencing (WES)  and whole genome sequencing (WGS) tests. The MGS and CCGP tests are for patients  whose disease shows a very characteristic phenotype strongly associated with mutations  in the mitochondrial genome, or in a few dozen candidate genes. The WES and WGS  tests are to be used in situations where one cannot generate a credible list of candidate  genes to be tested. These tests interrogate all coding regions or the entire genome,  respectively. In addition to identifying known disease causing mutations and probable  disease causing mutations in disease associated genes they can also identify entirely  new private mutations in genes previously not linked to the disease.  Confirmation of the  disease causing nature of these novel mutations is based on segregation of the mutation  in families and structural and functional characteristics of the mutation and the gene itself.     th Personalized Genomic Medicine Laboratory  630 West 168  Street  Department of Pathology and Cell Biology  P&S17-401  www.pathology.columbia.edu  New York, NY 10032    Tel: 212-305-9706  OFFICE USE    Fax: 212-342-0420   ONLY:   WGS sequencing reviewed:  Lab Acc. #:__________      Indication for testing   The presence of a congenital developmental abnormality of presumed genetic  origin   Development of symptoms that suggest the presence of a genetic disorder with  mitochondrial or Mendelian inheritance    Methodology   Hardware: Illumina sequencing instruments: MiSeq for MGS and CCGP tests and  HiSeq2500 for WES and WGS tests.    Capture reagents: We use PCR to capture the mitochondrial genome and Agilent  Sureselect technology to capture the regions of interest (ROI) for the CCGP and  WES studies.  The WGS does not require capture, since the entire genome is  sequenced.    Specimen requirements   All specimens should carry two independent identifiers.    Blood > 300microliters, should be anti-coagulated, preferably with citrate or EDTA  and should be less than a week old.     Muscle biopsy specimens (>50mg) should be refrigerated from the time of biopsy  to arrival to the lab.    DNA should be greater than 10kb median length. We optimally need 3 micrograms  of genomic DNA at concentrations 50-200ng/microliter.

panel (ccgp) the columbia combined panel is a genetic test that evaluates changes in your child s dna that might be the cause of your child s clinical condition. a gene is an individual unit of dna. exons are the most important regions of the gene that provide the instructions for the body to make proteins and chemicals that allow it to function properly. changes in genes, called mutations, can lead to disease. the columbia combined panel tests for exons of many genes at the same time. the genes are chosen based on their known role in diseases that cause symptoms similar to your child s symptoms. because this test examines a larger portion of the genetic material than traditional tests, it might discover the cause of disease in cases where other tests were inconclusive. because the columbia combined panel is more complicated than prior genetic testing your child may have had, the consent and ordering process must be thorough and will be done with the assistance of a genetic counselor and/or your doctor. how is the test done two tubes (two teaspoons) of blood will be collected from your child. based on your family tree, your genetic counselor or doctor may also recommend that blood be drawn from two or more members of your family, such as the child s father or siblings, to help with interpretation of test results. the genes tested by the ccgp are part of the dna in your child s blood cells. dna from your child s blood is purified, and the exome sequence is obtained (or read ) using high throughput sequencing. the sequence obtained for the genes included in the ccgp is then searched for changes that are known or suspected to cause disease. how is this test interpreted once the dna sequence of the exons of the genes of interest is read, the information obtained is analyzed for differences between your child s sequence and a reference ( normal) sequence. everyone has places in their sequence that are different from the reference. these differences make us unique and usually do not cause medical problems. to determine whether the changes that are found are neutral, or can cause disease, the following steps are taken: first, the variations in your child s sequence will be compared with a list of mutations that are known to cause medical problems in other people with symptoms similar to those seen in your child. subsequently one will examine whether disruptive mutations not previously described are present in genes that are known to cause the type of disease your child has. changes found will be compared to the changes seen in your selected family members with or without the disease (if available) to confirm that the changes are indeed the cause of your child s disease. 2. the primary purpose of the test (why it is being performed). the test is being performed primarily to detect a genetic cause for your child s condition. the condition is , which causes . the test results may be complex, so you must obtain genetic counseling before signing this consent. th personalized genomic medicine laboratory 630 west 168 street department of pathology and cell biology p&s17-401 www.pathology.columbia.edu new york, ny 10032

receiving the results what kind of results may be reported there are several different kinds of results that may be reported. all results will go directly to the healthcare provider who ordered the test. 1. positive for disease-causing mutation(s): your child may have one or more mutations that are known to cause a specific genetic condition in other individuals with symptoms similar to your child s symptoms. these mutations are interpreted as the cause of your child s symptoms. 2. no disease causing mutations or variants found: it is possible that the test will not find any genetic change that would explain your child s symptoms. this type of test result does not mean your child s condition is not genetic. the result would not take away whatever symptoms or current diagnoses doctors may have given your child. 3. variant with uncertain significance: sometimes the test will find a genetic variation that is predicted to be important, but has not been reported or seen before in people with your child s condition. such a variant may or may not be causing your child s symptoms, but the lab will report it as a variant of uncertain significance if there is evidence strongly suggesting that it is related to your child s condition. are there any types of results that will not be given to me yes, there are a few types of results that will not be included in the report your child s doctor gets. 1. mutations that are not directly related to your child s condition (incidental findings) will not be reported. 2. we might use your relatives samples to help us diagnose your child s condition, but we will not report results for these individuals. however, your child s genetic results might have implications for your relatives. it is important that you discuss these implications with your genetic counselor. 3. the dna that will be tested on the sequencer will include genes that are not related to your child s condition. we will not analyze these genes. therefore, results for these genes will not be available to you or us, and will not be reported. if your doctor decides to test for the other genes in our large panel of genes, he/she will have to order another test. what should i do if there is a positive result this is a test to identify a genetic cause of your child s clinical condition. if the test is positive for a genetic cause of your child s clinical condition, you may wish to consult your physician or have further genetic counseling or undergo further independent testing.  (initial) i understand that i have the option to seek further independent testing, and that i should obtain genetic counseling to help me understand the results. th personalized genomic medicine laboratory 630 west 168 street department of pathology and cell biology p&s17-401 www.pathology.columbia.edu new york, ny 10032 tel: 212-305-9706 office use fax: 212-342-0420 only: wgs sequencing reviewed: lab acc. #: are there limitations to the testing yes, there are several limitations to the columbia combined genetic panel: 1. the test is not able to detect mutations in genes that are not known to be associated with the symptoms that your child has. 2. the test report is generated based on current medical knowledge. a mutation that is not known to be the cause of a genetic condition today, may be shown to be disease-causing in a year or two. we do not generate updated reports for the test, unless we are requested to do so by the patient. there is a fee associated with providing an updated report. 3. the test is not currently validated to detect large-scale alterations in the dna content of the patient s cells. these include losses or duplications of many genes. another genetic test called a microarray is available for this purpose. it might be ordered by your child s physician before the ccgp testing. 4. the test may not be able detect genetic disorders that are caused by expansion of repetitive regions of the genome. one example is fragile x syndrome. if one of these conditions is suspected, your child s physician should order the appropriate test. 5. the test is not able to detect mutations in the part of the dna that is not part of the exons, (the coding portion of the gene), such as parts of the dna that help regulate gene function. 6. the test may detect findings of uncertain significance, which cannot be proven with complete certainty to be the cause of your child s condition (see types of results described above). 7. finding a disease-causing mutation may not result in a treatment, cure, or a prognosis (knowledge about the way a disease is expected to progress). 8. standard lab limitations caused by human error, such as sample contamination or sample mix-up, may occur but are unlikely.  (initial) i understand the limitations to ccgp 4. when dna testing detects the most common disease-causing changes in a gene, the test result is highly accurate. 5. implications of positive and negative results for your diagnosis predicting the results of ccgp in advance is not possible. predicting in advance what the results will mean for your child s health is also not possible. this is due to the fact that many genes are tested and many different positive results can be obtained. each of these different results will have potentially different implications. a negative result (not finding mutations responsible for your child s disease) will not change your child s diagnosis. 6. who will have access to the results the results of the ccgp become a part of the patient s medical record. test results are stored in the laboratory s computer records, and are normally automatically sent to computerized medical records of new york presbyterian hospital and columbia university. if you do not want these results to be sent to these records, you must inform us about this. unless you tell us not to transmit them, the results will become part of the patient s electronic medical record. even if they do not become part of the electronic medical record, the results may be made available to individuals/organizations with legal access to the patient s medical record, on a strict need-to-know basis. those with legal access include, but are not limited to the physicians and nursing staff directly involved in the patient s care, th personalized genomic medicine laboratory 630 west 168 street department of pathology and cell biology p&s17-401 www.pathology.columbia.edu new york, ny 10032 tel: 212-305-9706 office use fax: 212-342-0420 only: wgs sequencing reviewed: lab acc. #: the patient s current and future insurance carriers, after consent is obtained, and others specifically authorized by you or your authorized representative to gain access to your child s medical records.  (initial) i understand, that the results will be automatically transmitted to the patient s electronic medical records in the nyph and columbia university emrs, and i do not object to this. (initial) please do not transmit any of the results to the hospital s electronic medical records. i understand that the results will continue to be part of the laboratory s electronic information system. if the results are not entered in the hospital or university s electronic medical records, future physicians may not have access to those results. i understand i must assume responsibility for informing my child s future physicians of these results, or for requesting that physicians contact the columbia university personalized genomic medicine laboratory for these. 7. how long are the ccgp results kept in the testing lab the laboratory will keep the identified ccgp raw data for 5 years. the final report will be kept as long as possible, but at least 5 years. after this, the data from which the final report was generated will be de-identified, and will be stored in a database that does not include any names or other information that would link them back to your child. however, information about the type of disease and the type of symptoms associated with the genetic findings will be preserved. because this is a new test, it is important to keep track of the types of variants and mutations that are being found to help us improve our diagnostic capabilities. although your child would not directly benefit from this, others with similar conditions would. please indicate your choice below.  (initial) i agree to the ccgp data being stored indefinitely in a de-identified way.  (initial) i do not want ccgp data being stored indefinitely even if it is de-identified. 8. statement that no additional tests will be performed on this sample, without specific, signed authorization by the patient/legal representative, and that after 60 days, unless consent is given, the sample will be destroyed. how long are the samples kept in the lab blood and dna samples are normally discarded after 60 days, following test completion, unless you provide us consent to store the dna after testing is performed. storing your child s sample may allow you to request testing in the future without having to obtain a new sample, or to participate in future research, should you wish to do so. if you would like the dna to be stored after your child reaches the age of 18, the adult child (or legal representative) will have to request that the dna continue to be stored after that period.  (initial) please keep dna used in testing my child indefinitely for future testing should i desire such testing, or should i want to participate in research in the future. i understand no additional genetic tests will be performed without my specific consent/instructions. if i decide to participate in research in the future, i will instruct the laboratory, and there will be a requirement of a separate irb-approved consent. the dna may be used only for th personalized genomic medicine laboratory 630 west 168 street department of pathology and cell biology p&s17-401 www.pathology.columbia.edu new york, ny 10032 tel: 212-305-9706 office use fax: 212-342-0420 only: wgs sequencing reviewed: lab acc. #: quality control purposes, and i understand that there is no guarantee of its availability after 60 days.  (initial) do not keep dna used in testing my child associated with information that could identify my child, but you may use my child s de-identified dna for quality control purposes or for research in which the identity cannot be traced back to my child or my family. i understand that any research using the de-identified dna will require a specific irb approval and oversight.  (initial) please discard dna and other biologic materials used in testing my child 60 days after all testing is completed. 9. what are the risks of testing 1. identification of familial relationships: ccgp may identify familial relationships other than those originally reported. for example, non-paternity (when the reported father of the child is not the biological father) or half sibling-ships (when siblings do not share the same father and mother) would be detected. you may choose whether or not to be informed of this information, in case it is revealed during the testing. 2. discrimination. the genetic non-discrimination law prevents insurance companies from using your child s genetic information to deny health insurance coverage. however, the law does not cover life insurance, disability insurance or long term care insurance. the detection of an incidental condition may affect your child s future ability to buy these forms of insurance or get the best insurance rates. by new york state law, your consent is required for the release of these results to insurance companies. however, you may be required to release this information to the insurance companies for your contract with them to be valid. 3. requirement for further testing: ccgp may identify genetic changes that may require additional testing to evaluate. this could result in anxiety, uncertainty, and additional expenses that may or may not be covered by your insurance. 4. detection of untreatable conditions. ccgp may identify serious, untreatable genetic conditions. it can result in unexpected psychological trauma, both for you and your family. the detection of such a condition could also affect the health or health care needs of your child s siblings, or other close relatives. 10. statement of financial responsibility  (initial) i understand that i, having requested testing to be performed, am responsible for the cost of this testing and will be required to pay for any/all of the test cost if health insurance does not reimburse the laboratory. in addition, if health insurance pays for the test, i understand that the laboratory is required to bill me for the co-pay or coinsurance that is required by my health plan. 11. consent for ccgp testing all of the above has been explained to me, to my satisfaction, and my signature below attests to the same. signature of

reviewed: lab acc. #: description of high-throughput sequencing tests for genetic disorders offered by the personalized genomic medicine laboratory of columbia university medical center overview the human genome contains in excess of 20000 protein coding genes. in a constantly updated encyclopedia of mendelian human disorders, omim, as of october 16, 2012, there are about 3600 phenotypes described in which the molecular basis of the disease is known. there is also an additional 3600 phenotypes listed that have no known molecular basis to date. the number of genes described on the site is past 14,000, and all these genes are thought to be relevant to human disease, although maybe only half of them have a confirmed role in one or more genetic disorders. the current paradigm for genetic diagnosis rests on pcr and microarray-based detection of specific mutations of known significance and/or sanger sequencing that allows detection of previously described, as well as novel mutations, in genes that have been well established to play a role in a specific disease. these methods work well for screening for specific mutations or for demonstration of mutations in a small number of genes, if the gene(s) to test can be largely ascertained based on the clinical phenotype. however, they fall short in cases where the phenotype and genotype correlation is not strong enough to efficiently guide the decision-making process as to what mutation in which gene should be tested for. in cases like congenital hearing loss in which over 100 loci have been implicated, it is often impossible to establish in what order to perform the review of genes linked to the phenotype. even if a more logical phenotype based approach is available, like in the case of muscular dystrophies, the diagnostic odyssey is often too painful and expensive to undertake. since genetic information is changing at a rapid pace, clinicians may be unaware of all known genes and, therefore, fail to order the appropriate tests. ngs allows for simultaneous sequencing of large number of genes that might carry mutations causing the symptoms of a patient at an affordable price. this prevents individual clinician bias in testing decisions and improves diagnostic success rate. we offer four clinical ngs tests at the personalized genomic medicine laboratories at columbia university medical center. these are full mitochondrial genome sequencing (mgs), the columbia combined genetic panel (ccgp), whole exome sequencing (wes) and whole genome sequencing (wgs) tests. the mgs and ccgp tests are for patients whose disease shows a very characteristic phenotype strongly associated with mutations in the mitochondrial genome, or in a few dozen candidate genes. the wes and wgs tests are to be used in situations where one cannot generate a credible list of candidate genes to be tested. these tests interrogate all coding regions or the entire genome, respectively. in addition to identifying known disease causing mutations and probable disease causing mutations in disease associated genes they can also identify entirely new private mutations in genes previously not linked to the disease. confirmation of the disease causing nature of these novel mutations is based on segregation of the mutation in families and structural and functional characteristics of the mutation and the gene itself. th personalized genomic medicine laboratory 630 west 168 street department of pathology and cell biology p&s17-401 www.pathology.columbia.edu new york, ny 10032 tel: 212-305-9706 office use

suggest the presence of a genetic disorder with mitochondrial or mendelian inheritance methodology hardware: illumina sequencing instruments: miseq for mgs and ccgp tests and hiseq2500 for wes and wgs tests. capture reagents: we use pcr to capture the mitochondrial genome and agilent sureselect technology to capture the regions of interest (roi) for the ccgp and wes studies. the wgs does not require capture, since the entire genome is sequenced. specimen requirements all specimens should carry two independent identifiers. blood > 300microliters, should be anti-coagulated, preferably with citrate or edta and should be less than a week old. muscle biopsy specimens (>50mg) should be refrigerated from the time of biopsy to arrival to the lab. dna should be greater than 10kb median length. we optimally need 3 micrograms of genomic dna at concentrations 50-200ng/microliter.","['th personalized genomic medicine laboratory 630 west 168 street department of pathology and cell biology', 'p

Introduction  You are being asked to take part in a research study. This document has important information  about the reason for the study, what you will do if you choose to be in this research study, and the  way we would like to use information about you.      What is the reason for doing this study?  This study is being done to help us learn more about how genetic information related to certain  medications is used by physicians and how this information may impact patients. We are also  interested in learning how to best integrate this information into the electronic health record.  You  are being asked to participate because you are a physician in the Northwestern Medical Faculty  Foundation General Internal Medicine clinic.    What will you do if you choose to be in this study?   A study coordinator will meet with you in the General Internal Medicine clinic to tell you about the  study at a time convenient for you. This will take approximately 10 minutes of your time.  If you  consent to participate, you will be asked to:     Allow us to recruit eligible patients from your practice on your behalf     Review the list of eligible patients and let us know if there are any patients you wish for us to  not contact/recruit     Return and/or discuss patients’ genetic results (such as ones related to clopidogrel, warfarin, and  simvastatin) as you feel are clinically appropriate         STU00072134 Page 1 of 3 NU IRB Approved through     1/3/2014              Version Date: 01/11/2013     Participate in an approximately 45 minute long phone or in-person interview regarding your  experience with the results in the electronic medical record and speaking with your patients  about the results    What are some of the possible risks and discomforts?   Your participation in this study does not involve any physical, emotional, or psychological risk to  you. If you do not wish to answer a question during the interview, you may skip it and go to the  next question.      What are the Possible Benefits for Me or Others?   You may not benefit from this study.   Information obtained from this study may benefit your patients.

2019-05-13,../data//ic_adult,../data//ic_adult.txt,"USIDNet DNA and Cell Repository Informed Consent (adult)    I hereby consent to the collection of ____ml (___tsp) blood or a tissue biopsy for  submission to the USIDNet DNA and Cell Repository, a research resource supported  by the National Institutes of Health. The Repository collects, stores, and distributes cel  cultures and DNA samples from people with all forms of primary immunodeficiency  disorder, from unaffected family members, and from other healthy people. The samples  in the Repository will be maintained by and at Coriell Cell Repositories in Camden, NJ.    I understand that my sample will be used to create cell lines that will be added to the  Repository’s collection. The purpose of this collection is to make specimens readily  available for use in research and teaching. Since the Primary Immunodeficiency (PI)  diseases are rare, donation of my sample to the Repository may give a broader group of  scientists access to rare research materials from patients and families affected with  Primary Immunodeficiency. It is hoped that wider scientific access and study may help  to improve understanding of these diseases and to develop new diagnostic tests and  new treatments for these and other disorders.    The Repository will take strong measures to protect my privacy. All identifying  information will be removed from the blood or tissue specimen by my doctor before the  sample is submitted to the Repository. My specimen wil be given a unique code  number for future identification and the record maintained by the Repository wil only  contain general information such as age, sex, state of residence, diagnosis and  molecular defect (if known). The USIDNet Repository will not have my name, my  address or other specific identifying information to link the sample specifically to me and  therefore it is very unlikely that anyone would be able to determine in the future that the  sample was taken from me.    Because the link to my name has been broken, the USIDNet Repository wil be unable  to provide me with any information about scientific findings that may be discovered by  scientists working with my sample specifically or whether any results that are published  in the scientific literature are related to the sample that I submitted. I understand that a  potential link may remain between the sample and me if the USIDNet Repository keeps  a record of the name and address of the physician who submitted this sample. In this  event the USIDNet Repository could contact my doctor and potential y transmit back to  me study results or a request for me to participate in additional studies – although the  Repository would still not have my identity in its records and would not have enough  1    information to contact me without the assistance of my doctor. If my doctor is  unavailable or is unable to contact me for some reason, I understand that no contact or  exchange of information between the Repository and me concerning my sample will be  possible – nor wil it be possible for me to request removal of my sample from the  collection once it has been de-identified and submitted.    I would ( ) would not ( ) like to have my doctor’s name remain linked to  my coded sample in the Repository’s records.    I would ( ) would not ( ) like to be contacted by my doctor in the future  about the results of research studies performed on my sample or with  possible opportunities for me to join additional research studies.    There will be no direct benefit or payment to me for participating, but my sample may  benefit the community at large or some particular group. My sample will stay in the  Repository indefinitely and I will not be able to withdraw it sometime in the future.    The medical risks of providing these specimens are minimal. The risk for venipuncture  is minor transient pain and slight possibility of infection. The risk for skin biopsy is mild  local pain, slight bleeding, the possibility of a small scar, and slight possibility of  infection.    My donation is voluntary, and if I choose not to participate there wil be no penalty or  loss of benefits to which I am entitled.

2019-05-13,../data//PMBB Informed Consent (1),../data//PMBB Informed Consent (1).txt,"	    PENN Medicine BioBank        UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA  RESEARCH SUBJECT INFORMED CONSENT AND  HIPAA AUTHORIZATION FORM    Protocol Title: Penn Medicine BioBank  Principal Daniel J. Rader, MD  Investigator: University of Pennsylvania  (215) 573-4176  Secondary JoEllen Weaver  Contact: University of Pennsylvania  (215) 349-5027    Researchers are trying to learn more about cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and other health  problems. Much of this research is done using human tissue, such as blood. Through these  studies, researchers hope to find new ways to detect, treat, and maybe prevent or cure health  problems. Some of these studies may be about how genes affect health and disease, or how  genes affect response to treatment. Some of them may lead to new products, such as drugs or  tests for diseases.  We are asking you to let us store some of your blood and health information to use in these kinds  of studies. Any adult who gets care at Penn Medicine may be asked to donate to this BioBank. We  plan to collect samples on approximately 100,000 patients over the next 5 years.  You can choose to take part in this storage project or not. This consent form gives information to  help you decide. This form includes the HIPAA Authorization describing your confidentiality and  privacy rights. Please read it carefully and take all the time you need to make your choice. Be sure  to ask us as many questions as you want. Everyone who takes part in research should know that:  • Taking part may involve some risks.  • Taking part is voluntary. If you choose to take part, you can quit at any time.  • No matter what you decide, now or in the future, it will not affect your medical care.  WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS RESEARCH PROJECT?  The purpose of the Penn Medicine BioBank is to collect and store blood and health information so  researchers can use them in future studies.  Your blood may be used in a variety of research studies including basic medical, translational,  clinical, and epidemiological research.  Some of these studies may use your DNA. Human DNA is organized in pieces called genes that  provide the instructions to make our bodies work. Common diseases may be caused by several  genes that work together. Also, your blood may be used for the measurement of markers that  associate with disease or development of diseases. Some researchers might study the link of DNA  and other blood markers with clinical outcomes, including response to treatment.  Other studies may involve creating cell lines from your blood sample. These cells will be similar or  identical to you genetically. Cell lines may be kept for many years and may be used to develop  treatments for a variety of diseases and conditions.  	    Version 1.2 – 7/22/13 IRB Approval From 2/20/15 to 2/19/16 Page 1 of 4  	    PENN Medicine BioBank    WHAT IS INVOLVED?  Your participation will take approximately 15 minutes of your time. If you agree to take part, we will  ask you to sign this form. We will give you a copy to keep. Here is what will happen next:  1. We will get a blood sample from you. We will collect up to 3 tablespoons of blood from a  vein in your arm. This blood collection may be done in combination with other clinical  procedures, or an additional needle stick.  2. We will get some information about you and your health.  § We will ask you to provide some identifying information, such as your name, date of  birth, medical record number and contact information.  § We will ask you for some additional information about you, such as your race, health  history and family’s health conditions.  § We will get some health information from your medical record, examples include test  results, medical procedures, images (such as X-rays), and medicines you take.  § We will use your medical record from time to time to update this information.  3. We will store your sample and information in the BioBank, along with those from all the  other people who take part. There is no limit on the length of time we will keep it. Your  sample and data may be kept until they are used up, or until the Penn Medicine BioBank  decides to destroy them.  4. We will let researchers use the materials stored in the BioBank for approved studies.  Researchers from Penn, other universities, the government, and drug- or health-related  companies can apply to use the materials. A science committee at the BioBank will review  each request. There will also be an ethics review.  5. Some of your genetic and health information may be placed in scientific databases, along  with that from many other people. Information that could directly identify you will never be  included. Researchers who want to study the information must apply to the database.  WHAT ARE THE POSSIBLE RISKS?  The most common risks related to drawing blood from your arm are brief pain and/or bruising.  There is a risk that someone could get access to the data we have stored about you. In some  cases, it could be used to make it harder for you to get or keep a job or insurance. There are laws  against the misuse of genetic information, but they may not give full protection. We believe the  chance these things will happen is very small, but we cannot make guarantees.  There is a risk that someone could trace the information in a scientific database back to you. Even  without your name or other identifiers, your genetic information is unique to you. We believe the  chance that someone will identify you is very small. But the risk may grow in the future if people  come up with new ways of tracing information.  WHAT PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION DO RESEARCHERS WANT TO USE?  The researchers may want to use portions of your health information that they will need for their  research. If you enter the Penn Medicine BioBank, health information that may be used and/or  released include the following:  • Name  • Medical record number  • Dates, such as date of birth, medical events, and follow-up  • Address, telephone number  • Blood/cells/DNA  WHY IS MY PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION NEEDED?  Your information is used by the research team to do the research, to oversee the research, and to  see if the research was done right  	    Version 1.2 – 7/22/13 IRB Approval From 2/20/15 to 2/19/16 Page 2 of 4  	    PENN Medicine BioBank    WHO WILL BE ABLE TO SEE MY PERSONAL HEALTH INFORMATION?  Access to your personal health information for this research study will be restricted to the following  individuals:  • The Principal Investigator and the Investigator’s study team  • Penn researchers with approval from the Penn Medicine BioBank Steering Committee and  approval from the Institutional Review Board (IRB).  • Authorized members of the workforce of the UPHS and the School of Medicine and the  University of Pennsylvania support offices who may need to access your information in  the performance of their duties (for example, for research oversight and monitoring).  In addition to the individuals within the UPHS system outlined above, coded data may be shared  with external partners at other academic or commercial research laboratories. These external  partners may include the National Institutes of Health or other multi-institutional consortia.  For  external research, all direct identifiers will be removed; however, some indirect identifiers, such as  dates of service, may be released.  HOW WILL INFORMATION ABOUT ME BE KEPT PRIVATE?  Your privacy is very important to us and we will make every effort to protect it. We will remove your  name and other identifiers from your sample and information, and replace them with a code  number. Only BioBank staff and approved Penn researchers will have access to the code. All  people with access to the code must sign an agreement to keep your identity a secret. None of  your personal identifiers will be shared outside Penn.  Information that is shared outside Penn may no longer be protected by the federal privacy law   called HIPAA. But it will be protected as described in this form and may be covered by other privacy  laws.  HOW LONG DOES THE AUTHORIZATION LAST?  Your authorization for use of your personal health information for this specific study does not  expire.  WHAT IF I DECIDE NOT TO GIVE PERMISSION TO USE AND GIVE OUT MY HEALTH  INFORMATION?  Then you will not be able to be in this research study.  WHAT ARE THE POSSIBLE BENEFITS?  You will not get direct benefit from taking part. The main reason you may want to take part is to help  researchers make discoveries that might help people in the future.  ARE THERE ANY COSTS OR PAYMENTS?  There are no costs to you or your insurance. You will not be paid for taking part. If any of the  research leads to new tests, drugs, or other commercial products, you will not share in any profits.  Your donation is a gift.  WILL I FIND OUT THE RESULTS OF THE RESEARCH?  You should not expect to get individual results from research done using your sample. If  researchers determine that there is new information that should be shared with you, you will be  notified.  WHAT ARE MY OPTIONS?  Taking part in the BioBank is your choice. You can choose to take part or not take part. If you  choose to take part, you can change your mind at any time.  	    Version 1.2 – 7/22/13 IRB Approval From 2/20/15 to 2/19/16 Page 3 of 4  	      0406186498  PENN Medicine BioBank         WHAT IF I CHANGE MY MIND?

from you. we will collect up to 3 tablespoons of blood from a vein in your arm. this blood collection may be done in combination with other clinical procedures, or an additional needle stick. 2. we will get some information about you and your health. we will ask you to provide some identifying information, such as your name, date of birth, medical record number and contact information. we will ask you for some additional information about you, such as your race, health history and family s health conditions. we will get some health information from your medical record, examples include test results, medical procedures, images (such as x-rays), and medicines you take. we will use your medical record from time to time to update this information. 3. we will store your sample and information in the biobank, along with those from all the other people who take part. there is no limit on the length of time we will keep it. your sample and data may be kept until they are used up, or until the penn medicine biobank decides to destroy them. 4. we will let researchers use the materials stored in the biobank for approved studies. researchers from penn, other universities, the government, and drug- or health-related companies can apply to use the materials. a science committee at the biobank will review each request. there will also be an ethics review. 5. some of your genetic and health information may be placed in scientific databases, along with that from many other people. information that could directly identify you will never be included. researchers who want to study the information must apply to the database. what are the possible risks the most common risks related to drawing blood from your arm are brief pain and/or bruising. there is a risk that someone could get access to the data we have stored about you. in some cases, it could be used to make it harder for you to get or keep a job or insurance. there are laws against the misuse of genetic information, but they may not give full protection. we believe the chance these things will happen is very small, but we cannot make guarantees. there is a risk that someone could trace the information in a scientific database back to you. even without your name or other identifiers, your genetic information is unique to you. we believe the chance that someone will identify you is very small. but the risk may grow in the future if people come up with new ways of tracing information. what protected health information do researchers want to use the researchers may want to use portions of your health information

CONSENT FORM FOR PHASE I PORTION OF STUDY      The word “you” used throughout this document refers to you or your child.      WHAT IS THIS STUDY ABOUT?  This study is a clinical trial, a type of research study. Clinical trials include only patients who choose to  take part. Please take your time to make your decision about participating. You may discuss your  decision with your friends, family, and health care team. If you have any questions, you may ask your  study doctor.    You are invited to participate in this study because you have been diagnosed with neuroblastoma. Your  cancer has either grown back (relapsed) or has never gone away (persistent tumor) after standard  treatment. Standard treatment may have included chemotherapy, surgery, radiation therapy and/or high- dose chemotherapy with a stem cell transplant.      WHY IS THIS STUDY BEING DONE?    The purposes of this study are:  To find the highest doses of MLN8237, that can be given with irinotecan, and temozolomide without  causing severe side effects.    To find out the side effects seen by giving MLN8237 at different dose levels with irinotecan, and  temozolomide.    To measure the levels of MLN8237 and irinotecan in the blood at different dose levels    To determine if your tumor gets smaller after treatment with MLN8237, irinotecan, and temozolomide    To determine if specific gene changes makes you more prone to side effects from and/or response to the  combination of MLN8237, irinotecan, and temozolomide    To determine if the amount of something in your tumor called MYCN or Aurora A makes you more likely  to have a good response to the combination of MLN8237, irinotecan, and temozolomide    The research is being done because:    Currently there is no known effective treatment for your type of cancer.     This study will combine an oral drug called MLN8237 with two chemotherapy medicines called irinotecan  and temozolomide.        MLN8237 is an investigational drug that is not approved by the FDA.  MLN8237 blocks the function of a  protein that is important in the growth of cancer cells. This drug has been tested as a single-agent in  children with relapsed solid tumors, including patients with neuroblastoma.   In the laboratory, MLN8237  appears to make neuroblastoma tumors smaller.  This effect is even greater when MLN8237 is combined  with the chemotherapy drugs, irinotecan and temozolomide.      Irinotecan and temozolomide are both FDA-approved chemotherapy drugs.  These drugs are approved  for the treatment of certain adult cancers, but have also been used to treat children with cancer.  These  drugs have been used in combination in many people with neuroblastoma.  In some patients with  neuroblastoma, this combination reduces the amount of neuroblastoma.      Giving MLN8237 together with irinotecan and temozolomide may increase the effectiveness of this  combination.  We first need to find out the highest dose of MLN8237 that can be given safely together  with irinotecan and temozolomide.  This study will be the first study to test giving MLN8237 together with  irinotecan and temozolomide.  Once we have found out the highest dose of MLN8237 that can be given  with irinotecan and temozolomide, we will treat more patients with this combination to determine how  effective it is.      HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL TAKE PART IN THIS STUDY?    Between 17 and 44 people will take part in this study.       WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO ME IF I TAKE PART IN THIS STUDY?    Medical Tests Before You Begin the Study   You will need to have the following exams, tests or procedures to find out if you can received  the  treatment  part of the study. These exams, tests or procedures are part of regular cancer care and may  be done even if you do not join the study. These tests will also be done at various times throughout the  study and at the end of the study. The purpose of these tests is to see how well the treatment works and  to measure the status of your neuroblastoma. If you have had some of them recently, they may not need  to be repeated. This will be up to your study doctor.    Physical exam  Bone marrow tests#  Blood tests Various scans*  Pregnancy test   Urine tests     # Bone marrow tests are done by inserting a needle into the hip bone to remove the marrow which is  inside the bone.  * Various scans that are done for diagnosis and checking the response of the tumor to treatment. These  may include CT and /or MRI scans and MIBG or PET scans. We will recommend scans specific for your  case and we will answer your questions about these scans    During the Study      If the exams, tests and procedures show that you can be in the study, and you choose to take part, then  you will need the following tests and procedures during the study. They are part of regular cancer care.     Physical exam  Bone marrow tests  Blood tests and scans Various scans  Pregnancy test   Urine tests   Treatment Plan     The treatment will be given in cycles that each last 21 days.  A diagram of one cycle is shown in the  following figure.

This medicine is typically given in the  clinic.      You will receive temozolomide by mouth once a day on days 1-5.  The medicine is most commonly given  as a capsule.  If you have a hard time swallowing capsules, the medicine can also taken out of the  capsule and swallowed with applesauce or apple juice.  This medicine is given 1 hour before the  irinotecan is given.  This medicine is given on an empty stomach.      You will receive MLN8237 by mouth once a day on days 1-7.  The medicine can only be given as a tablet.   On days 1-5, this medicine is given 1 hour before the irinotecan is given.  This medicine is given on an  empty stomach.      When you join the study, you will be assigned a certain MLN8237 dose.  This study will test up to four  MLN8237 doses in groups of 3-6 patients. The starting MLN8237 dose for the first group of patients is  about 40% lower than what is currently being given to patients receiving MLN8237 alone without bad side  effects.  If this is tolerated without serious side effects, then the MLN8237 dose will be increased (“dose  escalation”) in groups of 3-6 patients until serious side effects are seen. At that point, investigators will  have found the highest dose of MLN8237 that can be given along with irinotecan and temozolomide  without bad side effects.  This part of the study is called the Phase I part of the study.       The doses of irinotecan and temozolomide are not increased during this study.  The doses used are  typical doses used to treat patients with neuroblastoma.    After the highest dose of MLN8237 that can be given with irinotecan and temozolomide has been found,  another group of 8-20 patients will be treated with that highest dose to help determine how effective this  combination is in treating neuroblastoma.  This part of the study is called the Phase II part of the study.      You will only participate in the Phase I part of the study.       Depending on the side effects you have and/or the side effects other patients have had on this study, you  may need to receive two other types of medicines to decrease the side effects of MLN8237, irinotecan,  and temozolomide.  The first type of medicine helps to boost your white blood cell count.  White blood  cells help fight infection and having low white blood cells can increase your risk of developing an  infection.  This type of medicine is called filgrastim or GCSF and is given once a day as a shot under the  skin until the white blood cell count has increased to a safe level.  This usually takes about 10 days for  each cycle of chemotherapy.   If your hospital uses a related medicine called pegfilgrastim, then you may  need just one shot under the skin for each cycle of chemotherapy. The second type of medicine helps to  prevent diarrhea.  These medicines are antibiotics that you would take by mouth for about 10 days during  each cycle.  Your study doctor will pick between one medicine called cefixime which is given once a day  and another medicine called cefpodoxime which is given twice a day.        You can receive up to 34 cycles of treatment (approximately 2 years) as long as you are not having bad  side effects and as long as your tumor is not getting worse.  Although other participating patients may  receive a different dose of MLN8237, your assigned dose of MLN8237 will not change during your  participation in this study unless you develop certain side effects that necessitate lowering your dose of  MLN8237.    When you have finished treatment with MLN8237, irinotecan, and temozolomide     After you stop treatment with MLN8237, irinotecan and temozolomide, you will continue to have tests and  scans done (listed below) to measure how much tumor is left. If test results show you have abnormal  organ functions, tests will be repeated monthly until test results are stable or normal. You doctor will tell  you how often these tests and evaluations will be done.    Medical Tests after the Study:    Physical exam  Bone marrow tests  Blood tests Various scans  Urine tests      A table detailing the tests and procedures required before, during, and after the study has been attached  to the end of this consent.    Determining blood levels of MLN8237 and irinotecan   One of the main research goals of this study is to find out the amount of MLN8237 and irinotecan in the  blood during this treatment.  Since this is one of the main goals of the study you are required to submit  extra blood samples in order to participate in the overall study.      On the first day of the first cycle of treatment, a small amount of blood (5 mL, or about a teaspoon) will be  drawn.  If you have a central line (such as a port or a Broviac), this sample can be drawn through that  line.  Otherwise, you will need to have blood drawn through a vein.      On the fourth day of the first cycle of treatment, a total of 36 mL (or a little more than 7 teaspoons) will be  drawn over 24 hours.  This schedule of blood draws is typically done as an outpatient.  If you have a  central line with only one lumen or tube and that lumen or tube is being used to give you the irinotecan,  then you will need to have at least 6 of these blood samples drawn through a vein.  Your study doctor  may recommend placing an IV catheter or tube in one of your veins through which the blood can be  drawn.  This may reduce the number of pokes needed for this part of the study.  If you have a central line  with more than one lumen or tube, you may be able to have these blood samples drawn through one of  the lumens or tubes that is not being used to give you the irinotecan.  Your study doctor can tell you  whether you will need some pokes or an IV catheter placed or whether your type of central line can be  used to draw these samples.      This amount of blood is considered safe to donate over this amount of time.  Samples will be sent to the  Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Philadelphia, PA and to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN for  testing.    Other Research Tests in this Study  You will be asked if you want to participate in optional research tests. This part of the study is optional.  The results of these tests would not be told to you or your doctor or become part of your medical record.  These results would also not be used to make decisions about your care while enrolled on this study. You  can decide not to let the doctors do these tests and still be able to be treated as part of this clinical study.  There are checkboxes on the next to last page of this consent form to mark whether you are willing to  participate in these optional studies.    Evaluating gene changes involved in breakdown and action of MLN8237 and irinotecan  One part of the research goal is to look for genetic changes in normal blood cells of patients to see if  these are related to how the liver handles MLN8237 and irinotecan, or whether you will have bad side  effects after taking these drugs. We may also look to see if other genetic changes impact how likely a  person is to respond to this drug combination. These tests are done on one sample of blood (one-two  teaspoons, 5-10 mL) taken from your central line (or port) at the start of the first cycle of therapy.  This  amount of blood is considered safe to donate.  The blood will be sent to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN  for testing.       Looking at Aurora A in neuroblastoma tumors  MLN8237 blocks the action of a protein called Aurora A.  Another research goal is to look at the amount  of Aurora A in neuroblastoma tumors to find out if the amount of Aurora A impacts whether tumors  respond to the combination of MLN8237, irinotecan, and temozolomide.  These tests are done on stored  neuroblastoma tissue from your previous tumor biopsies or surgeries.  If you agree to participate in this  optional part of the study, we will request that your hospital send us some of your stored neuroblastoma  tissue.  You will not need to have an extra biopsy or surgery to participate in this part of the study.  The  tissue will be sent to the University of California in San Francisco, CA.      HOW LONG WILL I BE ON THIS STUDY?     You can receive up to 34 cycles of treatment (approximately 2 years) as long as you are not having bad  side effects and as long as your tumor is not getting worse.      After you stop treatment, you will continue to have tests and scans done to measure how much tumor is  left. Your doctor will tell you how often these tests will be done. Researchers will continue to collect  information about you for a lifetime. Researchers will be in contact with your primary care doctor to see how  you are doing; whether your tumor has grown back and at what sites in the body; whether you have  developed any side effects from the treatment; or whether you have developed any additional cancer. Your  oncologist or family doctor will give the researchers this information at regular intervals.    CAN I STOP BEING IN THE STUDY?    Yes. If you are thinking about stopping the study, you should talk to your doctor before making a final  decision so he/she can tell you how to do this safely.     The study doctor may stop you from taking part in this study at any time if he/she believes it is in your  best interest; if you do not follow study rules; or if the study is stopped.    WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF THE STUDY?    You will participate in the Phase 1 part of the study.   A Phase I study looks at how common and serious  side effects can be for each patient at a specific dose of a drug. In a Phase I study, some patients may  have very serious side effects and could die as a result of these side effects.     In this study, researchers will be looking at side effects seen in patients taking different doses of  MLN8237 together with irinotecan and temozolomide. Since subjects will be assigned to different doses  of MLN8237, some subjects may receive doses that are too small to be effective while others may receive  higher doses that may cause increased side effects.    Everyone taking part in the study will be watched carefully for any side effects. However, doctors don’t  know all the side effects that may happen. Side effects may be mild or very serious. Other drugs may be  given to make side effects less serious and more comfortable (such as for nausea, headache or itching).  Many side effects go away soon after you stop taking MLN8237, irinotecan, and temozolomide, but it is  always possible that side effects can be serious, long lasting or may never go away. There is also a risk  of death. Patients are watched carefully and treatment will be stopped if bad side effects develop.  Because this combination has never been given to children before, there may be risks we do not know  about. You should talk to your doctor about any side effects that you have while taking part in this study.  While on the study, you are at risk for the side effects listed on the following pages.    Possible side effects of MLN8237  There is limited experience using MLN8237 in humans. The risks and side effects listed here and their  frequencies are anticipated or predicted based on tests in animals and some experience in people. It is  expected that MLN8237 toxicities will be reversible, however it is possible that MLN8237 will have their  toxicities that have not been observed in or predicted from its evaluation in animal studies and the few  studies in adults that have been conducted to date.    The frequency provided in the following table is approximate:    Risks and side effects related to MLN8237 include those which are :    Likley Less Likely  Rare but Serious  (Anticipated in 21-100 (Anticipated in 5 -20 children out of (Anticipated in <5 children  children out of every 100) every 100) out of every 100)    Fever with a low white blood cell count  Severe rash with   Fewer red blood cells in which could indicate infection and may redness and pain  the blood* require hospitalization and treatment of the skin on the   Diarrhea with antibiotics* palms of the   Inflammation and/or  Pain in the abdomen (belly) hands and soles  sores in the mouth that  Constipation of the feet.  may make swallowing  Mouth pain  Blistering of the  difficult and are painful  Chills skin.

If this  happens, you will have to come to the hospital to be treated with antibiotics. If your white blood cell is very  low and you get a fever, you may have to come to the hospital to get treated with antibiotics.    If you have a drop in the red blood cell count, the cells that carry oxygen around the body you may feel  tired. If your red blood cell count drops very low you may need a blood transfusion.    If you have a low platelet count, particles in the blood that help with clotting, you may have easy bruising  or bleeding. If the count is very low and there is bleeding, you might need platelet transfusions to help  stop the bleeding.    Transfusions may be accompanied or followed by fever and/or reactions that can cause kidney failure,  heart failure, anemia, hepatitis, A.I.D.S. (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) and other infections.    MLN8237 has a chemical structure that is similar to a group of drugs called benzodiazepines. These  drugs may cause dependence and withdrawal symptoms. Therefore, there is a theoretical risk that  MLN8237 could cause dependence and withdrawal symptoms, as well. It is possible that while taking this  drug, you will feel changes in your mood such as a sense of euphoria (joy) or a feeling of unhappiness  that could lead to depression and thoughts of hurting yourself. When stopping the drug, withdrawal  symptoms could include: anxiety, restlessness, difficulty sleeping, tremors, rapid heart-beat, nausea and  vomiting.     Since there is a possibility that this drug may cause sedation (or sleepiness), you should not drink  alcoholic beverages, since alcohol can also cause sleepiness. If you feel sleepy while you are on  this study, you should avoid driving or doing anything that may need your full alertness, such as  operating dangerous tools or machinery. This drug may also cause sleepiness if you are currently  taking an opiate such as morphine, dilaudid, or fentanyl.    We will tell you if we learn any new information that may affect your health, welfare, or decision to stay in  this study.    For more information about risks and side effects, ask your study doctor.

The timing and frequency of these  effects is as yet unknown. These may include multiple birth defects and abnormalities of  bone formation,  small size of baby at birth and increased risk of death of the unborn baby. Irinotecan is excreted in rat  milk but this is unknown for humans.    Possible side effects of G-CSF (such as Neupogen, filgrastim Or  Neulasta, Pegfilgrastim)    G-CSF is not an anti-cancer medicine.  It helps the growth of white blood cells that fight infection.

My name is ____________________________.    2.  You have a kind of cancer called Neuroblastoma that has either grown back or has never gone away  after treatment. We are asking you to take part in a research study because doctors want to learn  more about treating neuroblastoma using three medicines called MLN8237, irinotecan, and  temozolomide to see what effects (both good and bad) these medicines have on patients and their  cancer.  MLN8237 is a medicine that is given by mouth as a pill (tablet).  Irinotecan is a medicine that  is given into the bloodstream (either through your central line or through a small tube placed in a vein  in your hand or arm).  Temozolomide is a medicine that is given by mouth, usually as a pill (capsule)  though it can be given a different way if you cannot swallow capsules.  The doctors think that giving  these three drugs together may help get rid of neuroblastoma cancer cells.      3. If you agree to be in this study this is what will happen:     The medicines will be given in cycles that each lasts 21 days.  You will only get the medicine  during the first 7 days of each cycle.  You will continue to receive cycles of this treatment for up to  2 years unless you have bad side effects or your tumor gets worse.        MLN8237:   You will take MLN8237 by mouth once a day for the first 7 days every 21-day cycle.    Irinotecan:  You will take Irinotecan by I.V. once a day for the first 5 days every 21 day cycle.  Temozolomide:  You will take Temozolomide by mouth once a day for the first 5 days every 21-day cycle.     Other medicines (not chemotherapy):  You may need to take other medicines to help you with side effects of the three   chemotherapy medicines above.  These medicines may include Neupogen (given once a   day as an injection) or Neulasta (give each cycle as an injection) to help your normal blood   cells get better after chemotherapy.  To help with diarrhea, you may also take either   Cefixime (once per day) or Cefpodoxime (twice each day) by mouth for ten days during   each cycle of chemotherapy.    Coming to See the Doctors:  During and after you have finished the treatment, you will have appointments with the doctors who  are taking care of you. This is called “Follow-Up”.  This is to see how well the treatment has worked  so far. The doctors will want to do some special tests to find this information out. They will include;   Blood tests (we will do this twice each week to start with, and then less often)   MRI, CT, and MIBG Scans (special pictures of your tumor)   Bone marrow test (to look for tumor in your bone marrow)   Feel your belly, look into your eyes and ears, and listen to your heart and lungs.   Ask you and your parents a lot of questions about how you are feeling, how you are doing in  school, and any problems you might be having.   You may have to come to the clinic to have blood and platelet transfusions when the blood  counts are low or stay in the hospital if you have a fever with low blood counts.   You will come to visit your doctor every week or so to start with, then less often if everything is  going well.    To measure the amount of medicine in your blood, we will draw 9 blood samples (about 8  teaspoons total) on day 1 and day 4 during the first cycle of your treatment. You may need to  have a needle poke or a small plastic tube placed in a vein of your hand or arm for these  samples. If you have a central line, your doctor will be able to tell you if that can be used to  draw these bloods.    When you are in a research study, sometimes good things and bad things can happen    4. Sometimes things happen to kids in research studies that may make them feel bad. These are called  “risks’.  Some of the risks of this study are:   You may feel sick to your stomach and you may throw up.     You may feel tired.   You may have a bad appetite.   You might have a fever and maybe an infection where you will need to be in the hospital to  get medicines to treat the infection.  You may feel tired and weak and need a blood transfusion or  you may get bruises or have bleeding (most often a nosebleed) and need a platelet transfusion.   You may get sores in your mouth that make it difficult to eat and drink.  If this happens, you  may need some pain medicines and you may need to stay in the hospital.   You may get diarrhea.   The treatments may not work, and your tumor may grow, or it might come back again after the  treatment has finished. If this happens we will try other ways to stop the tumor from growing.   You could get a different kind of cancer, this doesn’t happen often, but can happen years later.   It is possible that you could die from the treatment or cancer.     Not all of these things may happen to you. None of these things may happen. Or things may happen that  the doctors don’t know about yet.    5. Will we do everything possible to keep your information private.     6. Things that happen to children in research studies that are good are called “benefits.” Some of the  good things for this research study could be: this treatment might make your neuroblastoma tumor  stay the same size or get smaller for some time. We hope to learn more about this new treatment  which could help other children with neuroblastoma.    7. Please talk this over with your parents before you decide whether or not to be in this study. We will  also ask your parents to give their permission for you to take part in this study.  But even if your  parents say “yes” you can still decide not to do this.      8. Being in this study is up to you.   You do not have to be in this study if you don’t want to. You may  stop being in this study at any time.    9. You can ask any questions that you have about the study. If you have a question later that you didn’t  think of now, you can call me or ask me next time.

CONSENT FORM FOR PHASE II PORTION OF STUDY      The word “you” used throughout this document refers to you or your child.    WHAT IS THIS STUDY ABOUT?    This study is a clinical trial, a type of research study. Clinical trials include only patients who choose to  take part. Please take your time to make your decision about participating. You may discuss your  decision with your friends, family, and health care team. If you have any questions, you may ask your  study doctor.    You are invited to participate in this study because you have been diagnosed with neuroblastoma. Your  cancer has either grown back (relapsed) or has never gone away (persistent tumor) after standard  treatment. Standard treatment may have included chemotherapy, surgery, radiation therapy and/or high- dose chemotherapy with a stem cell transplant.    WHY IS THIS STUDY BEING DONE?    The purposes of this study are:.    To continue to look at the side effects seen by giving MLN8237 with irinotecan, and temozolomide.  To determine if your tumor gets smaller after treatment with MLN8237, irinotecan, and temozolomide.   To measure the levels of MLN8237 and irinotecan in the blood at different dose levels.   To determine if specific gene changes makes you more prone to side effects from and/or response to the  combination of MLN8237, irinotecan, and temozolomide.   To determine if the amount of something in your tumor called MYCN or Aurora A makes you more likely  to have a good response to the combination of MLN8237, irinotecan, and temozolomide.    The research is being done because:    Currently there is no known effective treatment for your type of cancer.     This study will combine an oral drug called MLN8237 with two chemotherapy medicines called irinotecan  and temozolomide.        MLN8237 is an investigational drug that is not approved by the FDA.  MLN8237 blocks the function of a  protein that is important in the growth of cancer cells. This drug has been tested as a single-agent in  children with relapsed solid tumors, including patients with neuroblastoma.   In the laboratory, MLN8237  appears to make neuroblastoma tumors smaller.  This effect is even greater when MLN8237 is combined  with the chemotherapy drugs, irinotecan and temozolomide.      Irinotecan and temozolomide are both FDA-approved chemotherapy drugs.  These drugs are approved  for the treatment of certain adult cancers, but have also been used to treat children with cancer.  These  drugs have been used in combination in many people with neuroblastoma.  In some patients with  neuroblastoma, this combination reduces the amount of neuroblastoma.      Giving MLN8237 together with irinotecan and temozolomide may increase the effectiveness of this  combination.      HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL TAKE PART IN THIS STUDY?    Between 17 and 44 people will take part in this study.     WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO ME IF I TAKE PART IN THIS STUDY?    Medical Tests Before You Begin the Study   You will need to have the following exams, tests or procedures to find out if you can received  the  treatment  part of the study. These exams, tests or procedures are part of regular cancer care and may  be done even if you do not join the study. These tests will also be done at various times throughout the  study and at the end of the study. The purpose of these tests is to see how well the treatment works and  to measure the status of your neuroblastoma. If you have had some of them recently, they may not need  to be repeated. This will be up to your study doctor.    Physical exam  Bone marrow tests#  Blood tests Various scans*  Pregnancy test   Urine tests     # Bone marrow tests are done by inserting a needle into the hip bone to remove the marrow which is  inside the bone.  * Various scans that are done for diagnosis and checking the response of the tumor to treatment. These  may include CT and /or MRI scans and MIBG or PET scans. We will recommend scans specific for your  case and we will answer your questions about these scans    During the Study    If the exams, tests and procedures show that you can be in the study, and you choose to take part, then  you will need the following tests and procedures during the study. They are part of regular cancer care.     Physical exam  Bone marrow tests  Blood tests and scans Various scans  Pregnancy test   Urine tests     Treatment Plan   The treatment will be given in cycles that each last 21 days.  A diagram of one cycle is shown in the  following figure.

This medicine is typically given in the  clinic.      You will receive temozolomide by mouth once a day on days 1-5.  The medicine is most commonly given  as a capsule.  If you have a hard time swallowing capsules, the medicine can also taken out of the  capsule and swallowed with applesauce or apple juice.  This medicine is given 1 hour before the  irinotecan is given.  This medicine is given on an empty stomach.      You will receive MLN8237 by mouth once a day on days 1-7.  The medicine can only be given as a tablet.   On days 1-5, this medicine is given 1 hour before the irinotecan is given.  This medicine is given on an  empty stomach.      When you join the study, you will be assigned a certain MLN8237 dose.  This dose will be given to all  patients entering this part of the study, as it was determined in the first part of the study (phase I portion)  to be the highest dose of MLN8237 that can be given along with irinotecan and temozolomide without bad  side effects.  This part of the study is called the Phase II part of the study.       The doses of irinotecan and temozolomide are not increased during this study.  The doses used are  typical doses used to treat patients with neuroblastoma.         Depending on the side effects you have and/or the side effects other patients have had on this study, you  may need to receive two other types of medicines to decrease the side effects of MLN8237, irinotecan,  and temozolomide.  The first type of medicine helps to boost your white blood cell count.  White blood  cells help fight infection and having low white blood cells can increase your risk of developing an  infection.  This type of medicine is called filgrastim or GCSF and is given once a day as a shot under the  skin until the white blood cell count has increased to a safe level.  This usually takes about 10 days for  each cycle of chemotherapy.   If your hospital uses a related medicine called pegfilgrastim, then you may  need just one shot under the skin for each cycle of chemotherapy. The second type of medicine helps to  prevent diarrhea.  These medicines are antibiotics that you would take by mouth for about 10 days during  each cycle.  Your study doctor will pick between one medicine called cefixime which is given once a day  and another medicine called cefpodoxime which is given twice a day.        You can receive up to 34 cycles of treatment (approximately 2 years) as long as you are not having bad  side effects and as long as your tumor is not getting worse.  Although other participating patients may  have received a different dose of MLN8237, your assigned dose of MLN8237 will not change during your  participation in this study unless you develop certain side effects that necessitate lowering your dose of  MLN8237.    When you have finished treatment with MLN8237, irinotecan, and temozolomide     After you stop treatment with MLN8237, irinotecan and temozolomide, you will continue to have tests and  scans done (listed below) to measure how much tumor is left. If test results show you have abnormal  organ functions, tests will be repeated monthly until test results are stable or normal. You doctor will tell  you how often these tests and evaluations will be done.    Medical Tests after the Study:    Physical exam  Bone marrow tests  Blood tests Various scans  Urine tests      A table detailing the tests and procedures required before, during, and after the study has been attached  to the end of this consent.    Optional Research Studies  You will be asked if you want to participate in optional research tests. This part of the study is optional.  The results of these tests would not be told to you or your doctor or become part of your medical record.  These results would also not be used to make decisions about your care while enrolled on this study. You  can decide not to let the doctors do these tests and still be able to be treated as part of this clinical study.  There are checkboxes on the next to last page of this consent form to mark whether you are willing to  participate in these optional studies.    Determining blood levels of MLN8237 and irinotecan     One of the research goals of this study is to find out the amount of MLN8237 and irinotecan in the blood  during this treatment.  Participating in this portion of the study is optional for patients in this phase II part  of the study.      On the first day of the first cycle of treatment, a small amount of blood (5 mL, or about a teaspoon) will be  drawn.  If you have a central line (such as a port or a Broviac), this sample can be drawn through that  line.  Otherwise, you will need to have blood drawn through a vein.      On the fourth day of the first cycle of treatment, a total of 36 mL (or a little more than 7 teaspoons) will be  drawn over 24 hours.  This schedule of blood draws is typically done as an outpatient.  If you have a  central line with only one lumen or tube and that lumen or tube is being used to give you the irinotecan,  then you will need to have at least 6 of these blood samples drawn through a vein.  Your study doctor  may recommend placing an IV catheter or tube in one of your veins through which the blood can be  drawn.  This may reduce the number of pokes needed for this part of the study.  If you have a central line  with more than one lumen or tube, you may be able to have these blood samples drawn through one of  the lumens or tubes that is not being used to give you the irinotecan.  Your study doctor can tell you  whether you will need some pokes or an IV catheter placed or whether your type of central line can be  used to draw these samples.      This amount of blood is considered safe to donate over this amount of time.  Samples will be sent to the  Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Philadelphia, PA and to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN for  testing.    Evaluating gene changes involved in breakdown and action of MLN8237 and irinotecan    Another research goal is to look for genetic changes in normal blood cells of patients to see if these are  related to how the liver handles MLN8237 and irinotecan, or whether you will have bad side effects after  taking these drugs. We may also look to see if other genetic changes impact how likely a person is to  respond to this drug combination. These tests are done on one sample of blood (one-two teaspoons, 5-10  mL) taken from your central line (or port) at the start of the first cycle of therapy.  This amount of blood is  considered safe to donate.  The blood will be sent to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN for testing.       Looking at Aurora A in neuroblastoma tumors    MLN8237 blocks the action of a protein called Aurora A.  Another research goal is to look at the amount  of Aurora A in neuroblastoma tumors to find out if the amount of Aurora A impacts whether tumors  respond to the combination of MLN8237, irinotecan, and temozolomide.  These tests are done on stored  neuroblastoma tissue from your previous tumor biopsies or surgeries.  If you agree to participate in this  optional part of the study, we will request that your hospital send us some of your stored neuroblastoma  tissue.  You will not need to have an extra biopsy or surgery to participate in this part of the study.  The  tissue will be sent to the University of California in San Francisco, CA.      HOW LONG WILL I BE ON THIS STUDY?     You can receive up to 34 cycles of treatment (approximately 2 years) as long as you are not having bad  side effects and as long as your tumor is not getting worse.      After you stop treatment, you will continue to have tests and scans done to measure how much tumor is  left. Your doctor will tell you how often these tests will be done. Researchers will continue to collect  information about you for a lifetime. Researchers will be in contact with your primary care doctor to see how  you are doing; whether your tumor has grown back and at what sites in the body; whether you have  developed any side effects from the treatment; or whether you have developed any additional cancer. Your  oncologist or family doctor will give the researchers this information at regular intervals.          CAN I STOP BEING IN THE STUDY?    Yes. If you are thinking about stopping the study, you should talk to your doctor before making a final  decision so he/she can tell you how to do this safely.     The study doctor may stop you from taking part in this study at any time if he/she believes it is in your  best interest; if you do not follow study rules; or if the study is stopped.    WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF THE STUDY?    You may have side effects while on the study. Everyone taking part in the study will be watched carefully  for any side effects. However, doctors don’t know all the side effects that may happen. Side effects may  be mild and some patients may have very serious side effects and could die as a result of these side  effects.     In the first part of this study, researchers looked at side effects seen in patients taking different doses of  MLN8237 together with irinotecan and temozolomide. The dose of MLN you will receive was based on  the experience of the first portion of the study that has already been shown to be tolerated without bad  side effects in several children with neuroblastoma.  Your dose will not change with later courses of  treatment, unless it needs to be decreased due to side effects.     Other drugs may be given to make side effects less serious and more comfortable (such as for nausea,  headache or itching). Many side effects go away soon after you stop taking MLN8237, irinotecan, and  temozolomide, but it is always possible that side effects can be serious, long lasting or may never go  away. There is also a risk of death. Patients are watched carefully and treatment will be stopped if bad  side effects develop. Although this combination has been given to children in the first part of this study,  there may be risks we do not know about. You should talk to your doctor about any side effects that you  have while taking part in this study. While on the study, you are at risk for the side effects listed on the  following pages.    Possible side effects of MLN8237  There is limited experience using MLN8237 in humans. The risks and side effects listed here and their  frequencies are anticipated or predicted based on tests in animals and some experience in people. It is  expected that MLN8237 toxicities will be reversible, however it is possible that MLN8237 will have their  toxicities that have not been observed in or predicted from its evaluation in animal studies and the few  studies in adults that have been conducted to date.    The frequency provided in the following table is approximate:    Risks and side effects related to MLN8237 include those which are :    Likley Less Likely  Rare but Serious  (Anticipated in 21-100 (Anticipated in 5 -20 children (Anticipated in <5 children out of  children out of every 100) out of every 100) every 100)    Fever with a low white blood  Severe rash with redness   Fewer red blood cells in cell count which could and pain of the skin on the  the blood* indicate infection and may palms of the hands and   Diarrhea require hospitalization and soles of the feet.   Inflammation and/or treatment with antibiotics*  Blistering of the skin.  sores in the mouth that  Pain in the abdomen (belly)   may make swallowing  Constipation   difficult and are painful  Mouth pain  (painful mouth sores)  Chills   Nausea  Swelling caused by fluid   Vomiting  build-up in the tissues of the   A feeling of extreme arms and legs  tiredness not relieved by  Fever  sleep  Infections including those   Low numbers of white caused by bacteria, virus,  blood cells* called and fungus  lymphocytes and  Increase in the blood level of  neutrophils/granulocytes certain enzymes or bilirubin  that may make it easier (a waste product that passes  to get infections which through the liver) which  may be life threatening could indicate liver irritation   Fewer platelets in the or damage  blood*  Increased levels of a   Loss of appetite chemical (creatinine) in the   Sleepiness blood which could mean   Hair loss kidney damage    Excessive loss of water from   the body    Back pain   Dizziness    Cough   Shortness of breath   Low blood pressure      * If you have a decrease in the white blood cell count, the cells that fight infection, you may be more likely  to get an infection, including a serious infection that spreads through the blood stream (sepsis). If this  happens, you will have to come to the hospital to be treated with antibiotics. If your white blood cell is very  low and you get a fever, you may have to come to the hospital to get treated with antibiotics.    If you have a drop in the red blood cell count, the cells that carry oxygen around the body you may feel  tired. If your red blood cell count drops very low you may need a blood transfusion.    If you have a low platelet count, particles in the blood that help with clotting, you may have easy bruising  or bleeding. If the count is very low and there is bleeding, you might need platelet transfusions to help  stop the bleeding.    Transfusions may be accompanied or followed by fever and/or reactions that can cause kidney failure,  heart failure, anemia, hepatitis, A.I.D.S. (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) and other infections.    MLN8237 has a chemical structure that is similar to a group of drugs called benzodiazepines. These  drugs may cause dependence and withdrawal symptoms. Therefore, there is a theoretical risk that  MLN8237 could cause dependence and withdrawal symptoms, as well. It is possible that while taking this  drug, you will feel changes in your mood such as a sense of euphoria (joy) or a feeling of unhappiness  that could lead to depression and thoughts of hurting yourself. When stopping the drug, withdrawal  symptoms could include: anxiety, restlessness, difficulty sleeping, tremors, rapid heart-beat, nausea and  vomiting.     Since there is a possibility that this drug may cause sedation (or sleepiness), you should not drink  alcoholic beverages, since alcohol can also cause sleepiness. If you feel sleepy while you are on  this study, you should avoid driving or doing anything that may need your full alertness, such as  operating dangerous tools or machinery. This drug may also cause sleepiness if you are currently  taking an opiate such as morphine, dilaudid, or fentanyl.    We will tell you if we learn any new information that may affect your health, welfare, or decision to stay in  this study.    For more information about risks and side effects, ask your study doctor.

It may rarely be a life threatening event.  ** Birth defects and other serious abnormalities in the unborn baby have been noted with irinotecan in  animal studies at doses similar to or less than those used in humans. The timing and frequency of these  effects is as yet unknown. These may include multiple birth defects and abnormalities of  bone formation,  small size of baby at birth and increased risk of death of the unborn baby. Irinotecan is excreted in rat  milk but this is unknown for humans.

SAMPLE ASSENT FORM-Phase II     PHASE I/II STUDY OF MLN8237 IN COMBINATION WITH IRINOTECAN AND TEMOZOLOMIDE FOR  PATIENTS WITH RELAPSED OR REFRACTORY NEUROBLASTOMA    A New Approaches to Neuroblastoma Therapy (NANT) treatment protocol     INVESTIGATOR [Insert Name of Investigator]  [Insert Name of Institution]    [Insert Address (include City, State and Zip Code)]   [Insert Telephone/Fax Numbers]  [Insert Email]         1. My name is ____________________________.    2.  You have a kind of cancer called Neuroblastoma that has either grown back or has never gone away  after treatment. We are asking you to take part in a research study because doctors want to learn  more about treating neuroblastoma using three medicines called MLN8237, irinotecan, and  temozolomide to see what effects (both good and bad) these medicines have on patients and their  cancer.  MLN8237 is a medicine that is given by mouth as a pill (tablet).  Irinotecan is a medicine that  is given into the bloodstream (either through your central line or through a small tube placed in a vein  in your hand or arm).  Temozolomide is a medicine that is given by mouth, usually as a pill (capsule)  though it can be given a different way if you cannot swallow capsules.  The doctors think that giving  these three drugs together may help get rid of neuroblastoma cancer cells.      3.  If you agree to be in this study this is what will happen:     The medicines will be given in cycles that each lasts 21 days.  You will only get the medicine  during the first 7 days of each cycle.  You will continue to receive cycles of this treatment for up to  2 years unless you have bad side effects or your tumor gets worse.        MLN8237:   You will take MLN8237 by mouth once a day for the first 7 days every 21-day cycle.    Irinotecan:  You will take Irinotecan by I.V. once a day for the first 5 days every 21 day cycle.  Temozolomide:  You will take Temozolomide by mouth once a day for the first 5 days every 21-day cycle.     Other medicines (not chemotherapy):  You may need to take other medicines to help you with side effects of the three   chemotherapy medicines above.  These medicines may include Neupogen (given once a   day as an injection) or Neulasta (give each cycle as an injection) to help your normal blood   cells get better after chemotherapy.  To help with diarrhea, you may also take either   Cefixime (once per day) or Cefpodoxime (twice each day) by mouth for ten days during   each cycle of chemotherapy.    Coming to See the Doctors:  During and after you have finished the treatment, you will have appointments with the doctors who  are taking care of you. This is called “Follow-Up”.  This is to see how well the treatment has worked  so far. The doctors will want to do some special tests to find this information out. They will include;   Blood tests (we will do this twice each week to start with, and then less often)   MRI, CT, and MIBG Scans (special pictures of your tumor)   Bone marrow test (to look for tumor in your bone marrow)   Feel your belly, look into your eyes and ears, and listen to your heart and lungs.   Ask you and your parents a lot of questions about how you are feeling, how you are doing in  school, and any problems you might be having.   You may have to come to the clinic to have blood and platelet transfusions when the blood  counts are low or stay in the hospital if you have a fever with low blood counts.   You will come to visit your doctor every week or so to start with, then less often if everything is  going well.     When you are in a research study, sometimes good things and bad things can happen    4. Sometimes things happen to kids in research studies that may make them feel bad. These are called  “risks’.  Some of the risks of this study are:   You may feel sick to your stomach and you may throw up.     You may feel tired.   You may have a bad appetite.   You might have a fever and maybe an infection where you will need to be in the hospital to  get medicines to treat the infection.  You may feel tired and weak and need a blood transfusion or  you may get bruises or have bleeding (most often a nosebleed) and need a platelet transfusion.   You may get sores in your mouth that make it difficult to eat and drink.  If this happens, you  may need some pain medicines and you may need to stay in the hospital.   You may get diarrhea.   The treatments may not work, and your tumor may grow, or it might come back again after the  treatment has finished. If this happens we will try other ways to stop the tumor from growing.   You could get a different kind of cancer, this doesn’t happen often, but can happen years later.   It is possible that you could die from the treatment or cancer.     Not all of these things may happen to you. None of these things may happen. Or things may happen that  the doctors don’t know about yet.    Will we do everything possible to keep your information private.     1. Things that happen to children in research studies that are good are called “benefits.” Some of  the good things for this research study could be: this treatment might make your neuroblastoma  tumor stay the same size or get smaller for some time. We hope to learn more about this new  treatment which could help other children with neuroblastoma.    2. Please talk this over with your parents before you decide whether or not to be in this study. We  will also ask your parents to give their permission for you to take part in this study.  But even if  your parents say “yes” you can still decide not to do this.      3. Being in this study is up to you.   You do not have to be in this study if you don’t want to. You may  stop being in this study at any time.    4. You can ask any questions that you have about the study. If you have a question later that you  didn’t think of now, you can call me or ask me next time.

what is this study about this study is a clinical trial, a type of research study. clinical trials include only patients who choose to take part. please take your time to make your decision about participating. you may discuss your decision with your friends, family, and health care team. if you have any questions, you may ask your study doctor. you are invited to participate in this study because you have been diagnosed with neuroblastoma. your cancer has either grown back (relapsed) or has never gone away (persistent tumor) after standard treatment. standard treatment may have included chemotherapy, surgery, radiation therapy and/or high- dose chemotherapy with a stem cell transplant. why is this study being done the purposes of this study are: to find the highest doses of mln8237, that can be given with irinotecan, and temozolomide without causing severe side effects. to find out the side effects seen by giving mln8237 at different dose levels with irinotecan, and temozolomide. to measure the levels of mln8237 and irinotecan in the blood at different dose levels to determine if your tumor gets smaller after treatment with mln8237, irinotecan, and temozolomide to determine if specific gene changes makes you more prone to side effects from and/or response to the combination of mln8237, irinotecan, and temozolomide to determine if the amount of something in your tumor called mycn or aurora a makes you more likely to have a good response to the combination of mln8237, irinotecan, and temozolomide the research is being done because: currently there is no known effective treatment for your type of cancer. this study will combine an oral drug called mln8237 with two chemotherapy medicines called irinotecan and temozolomide. mln8237 is an investigational drug that is not approved by the fda. mln8237 blocks the function of a protein that is important in the growth of cancer cells. this drug has been tested as a single-agent in children with relapsed solid tumors, including patients with neuroblastoma. in the laboratory, mln8237 appears to make neuroblastoma tumors smaller. this effect is even greater when mln8237 is combined with the chemotherapy drugs, irinotecan and temozolomide. irinotecan and temozolomide are both fda-approved chemotherapy drugs. these drugs are approved for the treatment of certain adult cancers, but have also been used to treat children with cancer. these drugs have been used in combination in many people with neuroblastoma. in some patients with neuroblastoma, this combination reduces the amount of neuroblastoma. giving mln8237 together with irinotecan and temozolomide may increase the effectiveness of this combination. we first need to find out the highest dose of mln8237 that can be given safely together with irinotecan and temozolomide. this study will be the first study to test giving mln8237 together with irinotecan and temozolomide. once we have found out the highest dose of mln8237 that can be given with irinotecan and temozolomide, we will treat more patients with this combination to determine how effective it is. how many people will take part in this study between 17 and 44 people will take part in this study. what will happen to me if i take part in this study medical tests before you begin the study you will need to have the following exams, tests or procedures to find out if you can received the treatment part of the study. these exams, tests or procedures are part of regular cancer care and may be done even if you do not join the study. these tests will also be done at various times throughout the study and at the end of the study. the purpose of these tests is to see how well the treatment works and to measure the status of your neuroblastoma. if you have had some of them recently, they may not need to be repeated. this will be up to your study doctor. physical exam bone marrow tests# blood tests various scans* pregnancy test urine tests # bone marrow tests are done by inserting a needle into the hip bone to remove the marrow which is inside the bone. * various scans that are done for diagnosis and checking the response of the tumor to treatment. these may include ct and /or mri scans and mibg or pet scans. we will recommend scans specific for your case and we will answer your questions about these scans during the study if the exams, tests and procedures show that you can be in the study, and you choose to take part, then you will need the following tests and procedures during the study. they are part of regular cancer care. physical exam

a vein in your hand or arm) over 1 hour on days 1-5. this medicine is typically given in the clinic. you will receive temozolomide by mouth once a day on days 1-5. the medicine is most commonly given as a capsule. if you have a hard time swallowing capsules, the medicine can also taken out of the capsule and swallowed with applesauce or apple juice. this medicine is given 1 hour before the irinotecan is given. this medicine is given on an empty stomach. you will receive mln8237 by mouth once a day on days 1-7. the medicine can only be given as a tablet. on days 1-5, this medicine is given 1 hour before the irinotecan is given. this medicine is given on an empty stomach. when you join the study, you will be assigned a certain mln8237 dose. this study will test up to four mln8237 doses in groups of 3-6 patients. the starting mln8237 dose for the first group of patients is about 40% lower than what is currently being given to patients receiving mln8237 alone without bad side effects. if this is tolerated without serious side effects, then the mln8237 dose will be increased ( dose escalation ) in groups of 3-6 patients until serious side effects are seen. at that point, investigators will have found the highest dose of mln8237 that can be given along with irinotecan and temozolomide without bad side effects. this part of the study is called the phase i part of the study. the doses of irinotecan and temozolomide are not increased during this study. the doses used are typical doses used to treat patients with neuroblastoma. after the highest dose of mln8237 that can be given with irinotecan and temozolomide has been found, another group of 8-20 patients will be treated with that highest dose to help determine how effective this combination is in treating neuroblastoma. this part of the study is called the phase ii part of the study. you will only participate in the phase i part of the study. depending on the side effects you have and/or the side effects other patients have had on this study, you may need to receive two other types of medicines to decrease the side effects of mln8237, irinotecan, and temozolomide. the first type of medicine helps to boost your white blood cell count. white blood cells help fight infection and having low white blood cells can increase your risk of developing an infection. this type of medicine is called filgrastim or gcsf and is given once a day as a shot under the skin until the white blood cell count has increased to a safe level. this usually takes about 10 days for each cycle of chemotherapy. if your hospital uses a related medicine called pegfilgrastim, then you may need just one shot under the skin for each cycle of chemotherapy. the second type of medicine helps to prevent diarrhea. these medicines are antibiotics that you would take by mouth for about 10 days during each cycle. your study doctor will pick between one medicine called cefixime which is given once a day and another medicine called cefpodoxime which is given twice a day. you can receive up to 34 cycles of treatment (approximately 2 years) as long as you are not having bad side effects and as long as your tumor is not getting worse. although other participating patients may receive a different dose of mln8237, your assigned dose of mln8237 will not change during your participation in this study unless you develop certain side effects that necessitate lowering your dose of mln8237. when you have finished treatment with mln8237, irinotecan, and temozolomide after you stop treatment with mln8237, irinotecan and temozolomide, you will continue to have tests and scans done (listed below) to measure how much tumor is left. if test results show you have abnormal organ functions, tests will be repeated monthly until test results are stable or normal. you doctor will tell you how often these tests and evaluations will be done. medical tests after the study: physical exam bone marrow tests blood tests various scans urine tests a table detailing the tests and procedures required before, during, and after the study has been attached to the end of this consent. determining blood levels of mln8237 and irinotecan one of the main research goals of this study is to find out the amount of mln8237 and irinotecan in the blood during this treatment. since this is one of the main goals of the study you are required to submit extra blood samples in order to participate in the overall study. on the first day of the first cycle of treatment, a small amount of blood (5 ml, or about a teaspoon) will be drawn. if you have a central line (such as a port or a broviac), this sample can be drawn through that line. otherwise, you will need to have blood drawn through a vein. on the fourth day of the first cycle of treatment, a total of 36 ml (or a little more than 7 teaspoons) will be drawn over 24 hours. this schedule of blood draws is typically done as an outpatient. if you have a central line with only one lumen or tube and that lumen or tube is being used to give you the irinotecan, then you will need to have at least 6 of these blood samples drawn through a vein. your study doctor may recommend placing an iv catheter or tube in one of your veins through which the blood can be drawn. this may reduce the number of pokes needed for this part of the study. if you have a central line with more than one lumen or tube, you may be able to have these blood samples drawn through one of the lumens or tubes that is not being used to give you the irinotecan. your study doctor can tell you whether you will need some pokes or an iv catheter placed or whether your type of central line can be used to draw these samples. this amount of blood is considered safe to donate over this amount of time. samples will be sent to the children s hospital of philadelphia in philadelphia, pa and to the mayo clinic in rochester, mn for testing. other research tests in this study you will be asked if you want to participate in optional research tests. this part of the study is optional. the results of these tests would not be told to you or your doctor or become part of your medical record. these results would also not be used to make decisions about your care while enrolled on this study. you can decide not to let the doctors do these tests and still be able to be treated as part of this clinical study. there are checkboxes on the next to last page of this consent form to mark whether you are willing to participate in these optional studies. evaluating gene changes involved in breakdown and action of mln8237 and irinotecan one part of the research goal is to look for genetic changes in normal blood cells of patients to see if these are related to how the liver handles mln8237 and irinotecan, or whether you will have bad side effects after taking these drugs. we may also look to see if other genetic changes impact how likely a person is to respond to this drug combination. these tests are done on one sample of blood (one-two teaspoons, 5-10 ml) taken from your central line (or port) at the start of the first cycle of therapy. this amount of blood is considered safe to donate. the blood will be sent to the mayo clinic in rochester, mn for testing. looking at aurora a in neuroblastoma tumors mln8237 blocks the action of a protein called aurora a. another research goal is to look at the amount of aurora a in neuroblastoma tumors to find out if the amount of aurora a impacts whether tumors respond to the combination of mln8237, irinotecan, and temozolomide. these tests are done on stored neuroblastoma tissue from your previous tumor biopsies or surgeries. if you agree to participate in this optional part of the study, we will request that your hospital send us some of your stored neuroblastoma tissue. you will not need to have an extra biopsy or surgery to participate in this part of the study. the tissue will be sent to the university of california in san francisco, ca. how long will i be on this study you can receive up to 34 cycles of treatment (approximately 2 years) as long as you are not having bad side effects and as long as your tumor is not getting worse. after you stop treatment, you will continue to have tests and scans done to measure how much tumor is left. your doctor will tell you how often these tests will be done. researchers will continue to collect information about you for a lifetime. researchers will be in contact with your primary care doctor to see how you are doing; whether your tumor has grown back and at what sites in the body; whether you have developed any side effects from the treatment; or whether you have developed any additional cancer. your oncologist or family doctor will give the researchers this information at regular intervals. can i stop being in the study yes. if you are thinking about stopping the study, you should talk to your doctor before making a final decision so he/she can tell you how to do this safely. the study doctor may stop you from taking part in this study at any time if he/she believes it is in your best interest; if you do not follow study rules; or if the study is stopped. what are the risks of the study you will participate in the phase 1 part of the study. a phase i study looks at how common and serious side effects can be for each patient at a specific dose of a drug. in a phase i study, some patients may have very serious side effects and could die as a result of these side effects. in this study, researchers will be looking at side effects seen in patients taking different doses of mln8237 together with irinotecan and temozolomide. since subjects will be assigned to different doses of mln8237, some subjects may receive doses that are too small to be effective while others may receive higher doses that may cause increased side effects. everyone taking part in the study will be watched carefully for any side effects. however, doctors don t know all the side effects that may happen. side effects may be mild or very serious. other drugs may be given to make side effects less serious and more comfortable (such as for nausea, headache or itching). many side effects go away soon after you stop taking mln8237, irinotecan, and temozolomide, but it is always possible that side effects can be serious, long lasting or may never go away. there is also a risk of death. patients are watched carefully and treatment will be stopped if bad side effects develop. because this combination has never been given to children before, there may be risks we do not know about. you should talk to your doctor about any side effects that you have while taking part in this study. while on the study, you are at risk for the side effects listed on the following pages. possible side effects of mln8237 there is limited experience using mln8237 in humans. the risks and side effects listed here and their frequencies are anticipated or predicted based on tests in animals and some experience in people. it is expected that mln8237 toxicities will be reversible, however it is possible that mln8237 will have their toxicities that have not been observed in or predicted from its evaluation in animal studies and the few studies in adults that have been conducted to date. the frequency provided in the following table is approximate: risks and side effects related to mln8237 include those which are : likley less likely rare but serious (anticipated in 21-100 (anticipated in 5 -20 children out of (anticipated in <5 children children out of every 100) every 100) out of every 100) fever with a low white blood cell count severe rash with fewer red blood cells in which could indicate infection and may redness

(acquired immune deficiency syndrome) and other infections. mln8237 has a chemical structure that is similar to a group of drugs called benzodiazepines. these drugs may cause dependence and withdrawal symptoms. therefore, there is a theoretical risk that mln8237 could cause dependence and withdrawal symptoms, as well. it is possible that while taking this drug, you will feel changes in your mood such as a sense of euphoria (joy) or a feeling of unhappiness that could lead to depression and thoughts of hurting yourself. when stopping the drug, withdrawal symptoms could include: anxiety, restlessness, difficulty sleeping, tremors, rapid heart-beat, nausea and vomiting. since there is a possibility that this drug may cause sedation (or sleepiness), you should not drink alcoholic beverages, since alcohol can also cause sleepiness. if you feel sleepy while you are on this study, you should avoid driving or doing anything that may need your full alertness, such as operating dangerous tools or machinery. this drug may also cause sleepiness if you are currently taking an opiate such as morphine, dilaudid, or fentanyl. we will tell you if we learn any new information that may affect your health, welfare, or decision to stay in this study. for more information about risks and side effects, ask your study doctor. possible side effects of temozolomide likely less likely

treatment protocol investigator [insert name of investigator] [insert name of institution] [insert address (include city, state and zip code)] [insert telephone/fax numbers] [insert email] 1. my name is . 2. you have a kind of cancer called neuroblastoma that has either grown back or has never gone away after treatment. we are asking you to take part in a research study because doctors want to learn more about treating neuroblastoma using three medicines called mln8237, irinotecan, and temozolomide to see what effects (both good and bad) these medicines have on patients and their cancer. mln8237 is a medicine that is given by mouth as a pill (tablet). irinotecan is a medicine that is given into the bloodstream (either through your central line or through a small tube placed in a vein in your hand or arm). temozolomide is a medicine that is given by mouth, usually as a pill (capsule) though it can be given a different way if you cannot swallow capsules. the doctors think that giving these three drugs together may help get rid of neuroblastoma cancer cells. 3. if you agree to be in this study this is what will happen: the medicines will be given in cycles that each lasts 21 days. you will only get the medicine during the first 7 days of each cycle. you will continue to receive cycles of this treatment for up to 2 years unless you have bad side effects or your tumor gets worse. mln8237: you will take mln8237 by mouth once a day for the first 7 days every 21-day cycle. irinotecan: you will take irinotecan by i.v. once a day for the first 5 days every 21 day cycle. temozolomide: you will take temozolomide by mouth once a day for the first 5 days every 21-day cycle. other medicines (not chemotherapy): you may need to take other medicines to help you with side effects of the three chemotherapy medicines above. these medicines may include neupogen (given once a day as an injection) or neulasta (give each cycle as an injection) to help your normal blood cells get better after chemotherapy. to help with diarrhea, you may also take either cefixime (once per day) or cefpodoxime (twice each day) by mouth for ten days during each cycle of chemotherapy. coming to see the doctors: during and after you have finished the treatment, you will have appointments with the doctors who are taking care of you. this is called follow-up . this is to see how well the treatment has worked so far. the doctors will want to do some special tests to find this information out. they will include; blood tests (we will do this twice each week to start with, and then less often) mri, ct, and mibg scans (special pictures of your tumor) bone marrow test (to look for tumor in your bone marrow) feel your belly, look into your eyes and ears, and listen to your heart and lungs. ask you and your parents a lot of questions about how you are feeling, how you are doing in school, and any problems you might be having. you may have to come to the clinic to have blood and platelet transfusions when the blood counts are low or stay in the hospital if you have a fever with low blood counts. you will come to visit your doctor every week or so to start with, then less often if everything is going well. to measure the amount of medicine in your blood, we will draw 9 blood samples (about 8 teaspoons total) on day 1 and day 4 during the first cycle of your treatment. you may need to have a needle poke or a small plastic tube placed in a vein of your hand or arm for these samples. if you have a central line, your doctor will be able to tell you if that can be used to draw these bloods. when you are in a research study, sometimes good things and bad things can happen 4. sometimes things happen to kids in research studies that may make them feel bad. these are called risks . some of the risks of this study are: you may feel sick to your stomach and you may throw up. you may feel tired. you may have a bad appetite. you might have a fever and maybe an infection where you will need to be in the hospital to get medicines to treat the infection. you may feel tired and weak and need a blood transfusion or you may get bruises or have bleeding (most often a nosebleed) and need a platelet transfusion. you may get sores in your mouth that make it difficult to eat and drink. if this happens, you may need some pain medicines and you may need to stay in the hospital. you may get diarrhea. the treatments may not work, and your tumor may grow, or it might come back again after the treatment has finished. if this happens we will try other ways to stop the tumor from growing. you could get a different kind of cancer, this doesn t happen often, but can happen years later. it is possible that you could die from the treatment or cancer. not all of these things may happen to you. none of these things may happen. or things may happen that the doctors don t know about yet. 5. will we do everything possible to keep your information private. 6. things that happen to children in research studies that are good are called benefits. some of the good things for this research study could be: this treatment might make your neuroblastoma tumor stay the same size or get smaller for some time. we hope to learn more about this new treatment which could help other children with neuroblastoma. 7. please talk this over with your parents before you decide whether or not to be in this study. we will also ask your parents to give their permission for you to take part in this study. but even if your parents say yes you can still decide not to do this. 8. being in this study is up to you. you do not have to be in this study if you don t want to. you may stop being in this study at any time. 9. you can ask any questions that you have about the study. if you have a question later that you didn t think of now, you can call me or ask me next time. study doctor s phone number: . 10. special study blood tests : there are extra special tests in this study. these are done solely for research purposes only. neither you nor your doctor will know the results. #1 one blood sample (1-2 teaspoons) is needed on day 1 of the first cycle of your treatment.  yes, it is okay to take an extra blood sample  no, it is not okay to take an extra blood sample #2 your stored neuroblastoma tissue sample will be used for research purposes in this study.

study. you and your parents will be given a copy of this form after you have signed it. name of subject:    signature of subject: date   signature of investigator date   signature of person conducting discussion date sample informed consent: phase ii phase i/ii study of mln8237 in combination with irinotecan and temozolomide for patients with relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma a new approaches to neuroblastoma therapy (nant) treatment protocol. consent form for phase ii portion of study the word you used throughout this document refers to you or your child. what is this study about this study is a clinical trial, a type of research study. clinical trials include only patients who choose to take part. please take your time to make your decision about participating. you may discuss your decision with your friends, family, and health care team. if you have any questions, you may ask your study doctor. you are invited to participate in this study because you have been diagnosed with neuroblastoma. your cancer has either grown back (relapsed) or has never gone away (persistent tumor) after standard treatment. standard treatment may have included chemotherapy, surgery, radiation therapy and/or high- dose chemotherapy with a stem cell transplant. why is this study being done the purposes of this study are:. to continue to look at the side effects seen by giving mln8237 with irinotecan, and temozolomide. to determine if your tumor gets smaller after treatment with mln8237, irinotecan, and temozolomide. to measure the levels of mln8237 and irinotecan in the blood at different dose levels. to determine if specific gene changes makes you more prone to side effects from and/or response to the combination of mln8237, irinotecan, and temozolomide. to determine if the amount of something in your tumor called mycn or aurora a makes you more likely to have a good response to the combination of mln8237, irinotecan, and temozolomide. the research is being done because: currently there is no known effective treatment for your type of cancer. this study will combine an oral drug called mln8237 with two chemotherapy medicines called irinotecan and temozolomide. mln8237 is an investigational drug that is not approved by the fda. mln8237 blocks the function of a protein that is important in the growth of cancer cells. this drug has been tested as a single-agent in children with relapsed solid tumors, including patients with neuroblastoma. in the laboratory, mln8237 appears to make neuroblastoma tumors smaller. this effect is even greater when mln8237 is combined with the chemotherapy drugs, irinotecan and temozolomide. irinotecan and temozolomide are both fda-approved chemotherapy drugs. these drugs are approved for the treatment of certain adult cancers, but have also been used to treat children with cancer. these drugs have been used in combination in many people with neuroblastoma. in some patients with neuroblastoma, this combination reduces the amount of neuroblastoma. giving mln8237 together with irinotecan and temozolomide may increase the effectiveness of this combination. how many people will take part in this study between 17 and 44 people will take part in this study. what will happen to me if i take part in this study medical tests before you begin the study you will need to have the following exams, tests or procedures to find out if you can received the treatment part of the study. these exams, tests or procedures are part of regular cancer care and may be done even if you do not join the study. these tests will also be done at various times throughout the study and at the end of the study. the purpose of these tests is to see how well the treatment works and to measure the status of your neuroblastoma. if you have had some of them recently, they may not need to be repeated. this will be up to your study doctor. physical exam bone marrow tests# blood tests various scans* pregnancy test urine tests # bone marrow tests are done by inserting a needle into the hip bone to remove the marrow which is inside the bone. * various scans that are done for diagnosis and checking the response of the tumor to treatment. these may include ct and /or mri scans and mibg or pet scans. we will recommend scans specific for your case and we will answer your questions about these scans during the study if the exams, tests and procedures show that you can be in the study, and you choose to take part, then you will need the following tests and procedures during the study. they are part of regular cancer care. physical exam bone marrow tests blood tests and scans various scans pregnancy test urine tests treatment plan the treatment will be given in cycles that each last 21 days. a diagram of one cycle is shown in the following figure. day: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 21 ir ir ir ir ir t t t t t m m m m m m m ir = irinotecan given into the bloodstream on days 1-5 t = temozolomide given by mouth on days 1-5 m = mln8237 given by mouth on days 1-7 disease evaluation after cycles 2, 4, 8, and then every 4 cycles you will receive irinotecan into the bloodstream (either through your central line or through a small tube placed in a vein in your hand or arm) over 1 hour on days 1-5. this medicine is typically given in the clinic. you will receive temozolomide by mouth once a day on days 1-5. the medicine is most commonly given as a capsule. if you have a hard time swallowing capsules, the medicine can also taken out of the capsule and swallowed with applesauce or apple juice. this medicine is given 1 hour before the irinotecan is given. this medicine is given on an empty stomach. you will receive mln8237 by mouth once a day on days 1-7. the medicine can only be given as a tablet. on days 1-5, this medicine is given 1 hour before the irinotecan is given. this medicine is given on an empty stomach. when you join the study, you will be assigned a certain mln8237 dose. this dose will be given to all patients entering this part of the study, as it was determined in the first part of the study (phase i portion) to be the highest dose of mln8237 that can be given along with irinotecan and temozolomide without bad side effects. this part of the study is called the phase ii part of the study. the doses of irinotecan and temozolomide are not increased during this study. the doses used are typical doses used to treat patients with neuroblastoma. depending on the side effects you have and/or the side effects other patients have had on this study, you may need to receive two other types of medicines to decrease the side effects of mln8237, irinotecan, and temozolomide. the first type of medicine helps to boost your white blood cell count. white blood cells help fight infection and having low white blood cells can increase your risk of developing an infection. this type of medicine is called filgrastim or gcsf and is given once a day as a shot under the skin until the white blood cell count has increased to a safe level. this usually takes about 10 days for each cycle of chemotherapy. if your hospital uses a related medicine called pegfilgrastim, then you may need just one shot under the skin for each cycle of chemotherapy. the second type of medicine helps to prevent diarrhea. these medicines are antibiotics that you would take by mouth for about 10 days during each cycle. your study doctor will pick between one medicine called cefixime which is given once a day and another medicine called cefpodoxime which is given twice a day. you can receive up to 34 cycles of treatment (approximately 2 years) as long as you are not having bad side effects and as long as your tumor is not getting worse. although other participating patients may have received a different dose of mln8237, your assigned dose of mln8237 will not change during your participation in this study unless you develop certain side effects that necessitate lowering your dose of mln8237. when you have finished treatment with mln8237, irinotecan, and temozolomide after you stop treatment with mln8237, irinotecan and temozolomide, you will continue to have tests and scans done (listed below) to measure how much tumor is left. if test results show you have abnormal organ functions, tests will be repeated monthly until test results are stable or normal. you doctor will tell you how often these tests and evaluations will be done. medical tests after the study: physical exam bone marrow tests blood tests various scans urine tests a table detailing the tests and procedures required before, during, and after the study has been attached to the end of this consent. optional research studies you will be asked if you want to participate in optional research tests. this part of the study is optional. the results of these tests would not be told to you or your doctor or become part of your medical record. these results would also not be used to make decisions about your care while enrolled on this study. you can decide not to let the doctors do these tests and still be able to be treated as part of this clinical study. there are checkboxes on the next to last page of this consent form to mark whether you are willing to participate in these optional studies. determining blood levels of mln8237 and irinotecan one of the research goals of this study is to find out the amount of mln8237 and irinotecan in the blood during this treatment. participating in this portion of the study is optional for patients in this phase ii part of the study. on the first day of the first cycle of treatment, a small amount of blood (5 ml, or about a teaspoon) will be drawn. if you have a central line (such as a port or a broviac), this sample can be drawn through that line. otherwise, you will need to have blood drawn through a vein. on the fourth day of the first cycle of treatment, a total of 36 ml (or a little more than 7 teaspoons) will be drawn over 24 hours. this schedule of blood draws is typically done as an outpatient. if you have a central line with only one lumen or tube and that lumen or tube is being used to give you the irinotecan, then you will need to have at least 6 of these blood samples drawn through a vein. your study doctor may recommend placing an iv catheter or tube in one of your veins through which the blood can be drawn. this may reduce the number of pokes needed for this part of the study. if you have a central line with more than one lumen or tube, you may be able to have these blood samples drawn through one of the lumens or tubes that is not being used to give you the irinotecan. your study doctor can tell you whether you will need some pokes or an iv catheter placed or whether your type of central line can be used to draw these samples. this amount of blood is considered safe to donate over this amount of time. samples will be sent to the children s hospital of philadelphia in philadelphia, pa and to the mayo clinic in rochester, mn for testing. evaluating gene changes involved in breakdown and action of mln8237 and irinotecan another research goal is to look for genetic changes in normal blood cells of patients to see if these are related to how the liver handles mln8237 and irinotecan, or whether you will have bad side effects after taking these drugs. we may also look to see if other genetic changes impact how likely a person is to respond to this drug combination. these tests are done on one sample of blood (one-two teaspoons, 5-10 ml) taken from your central line (or port) at the start of the first cycle of therapy. this amount of blood is considered safe to donate. the blood will be sent to the mayo clinic in rochester, mn for testing. looking at aurora a in neuroblastoma tumors mln8237 blocks the action of a protein called aurora a. another research goal is to look at the amount of aurora a in neuroblastoma tumors to find out if the amount of aurora a impacts whether tumors respond to the combination of mln8237, irinotecan, and temozolomide. these tests are done on stored neuroblastoma tissue from your previous tumor biopsies or surgeries. if you agree to participate in this optional part of the study, we will request that your hospital send us some of your stored neuroblastoma tissue. you will not need to have an extra biopsy or surgery to participate in this part of the study. the tissue will be sent to the university of california in san francisco, ca. how long will i be on this study you can receive up to 34 cycles of treatment (approximately 2 years) as long as you are not having bad side effects and as long as your tumor is not getting worse. after you stop treatment, you will continue to have tests and scans done to measure how much tumor is left. your doctor will tell you how often these tests will be done. researchers will continue to collect information about you for a lifetime. researchers will be in contact with your primary care doctor to see how you are doing; whether your tumor has grown back and at what sites in the body; whether you have developed any side effects from the treatment; or whether you have developed any additional cancer. your oncologist or family doctor will give the researchers this information at regular intervals. can i stop being in the study yes. if you are thinking about stopping the study, you should talk to your doctor before making a final decision so he/she can tell you how to do this safely. the study doctor may stop you from taking part in this study at any time if he/she believes it is in your best interest; if you do not follow study rules; or if the study is stopped. what are the risks of the study you may have side effects while on the study. everyone taking part in the study will be watched carefully for any side effects. however, doctors don t know all the side effects that may happen. side effects may be mild and some patients may have very serious side effects and could die as a result of these side effects. in the first part of this study, researchers looked at side effects seen in patients taking different doses of mln8237 together with irinotecan and temozolomide. the dose of mln you will receive was based on the experience of the first portion of the study that has already been shown to be tolerated without bad side effects in several children with neuroblastoma. your dose will not change with later courses of treatment, unless it needs to be decreased due to side effects. other drugs may be given to make side effects less serious and more comfortable (such as for nausea, headache or itching). many side effects go away soon after you stop taking mln8237, irinotecan, and temozolomide, but it is always possible that side effects can be serious, long lasting or may never go away. there is also a risk of death. patients are watched carefully and treatment will be stopped if bad side effects develop. although this combination has been given to children in the first part of this study, there may be risks we do not know about. you should talk to your doctor about any side effects that you have while taking part in this study. while on the study, you are at risk for the side effects listed on the following pages. possible side effects of mln8237 there is limited experience using mln8237 in humans. the risks and side effects listed here and their frequencies are anticipated or predicted based on tests in animals and some experience in people. it is expected that mln8237 toxicities will be reversible, however it is possible that mln8237 will have their toxicities that have not been observed in or predicted from its evaluation in animal studies and the few studies in adults that have been conducted to date. the frequency provided in the following table is approximate: risks and side effects related to mln8237 include those which are : likley less likely rare but serious (anticipated in 21-100 (anticipated in 5 -20 children (anticipated in <5 children out of children out of every 100) out of every 100) every 100) fever with a low white blood severe rash with redness fewer red blood cells in cell count which could and

blood which could mean hair loss kidney damage excessive loss of water from the body back pain dizziness cough shortness of breath low blood pressure * if you have a decrease in the white blood cell count, the cells that fight infection, you may be more likely to get an infection, including a serious infection that spreads through the blood stream (sepsis). if this happens, you will have to come to the hospital to be treated with antibiotics. if your white blood cell is very low and you get a fever, you may have to come to the hospital to get treated with antibiotics. if you have a drop in the red blood cell count, the cells that carry oxygen around the body you may feel tired. if your red blood cell count drops very low you may need a blood transfusion. if you have a low platelet count, particles in the blood that help with clotting, you may have easy bruising or bleeding. if the count is very low and there is bleeding, you might need platelet transfusions to help stop the bleeding. transfusions may be accompanied or followed by fever and/or reactions that can cause kidney failure, heart failure, anemia, hepatitis, a.i.d.s. (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) and other infections. mln8237 has a chemical structure that is similar to a group of drugs called benzodiazepines. these drugs may cause dependence and withdrawal symptoms. therefore, there is a theoretical risk that mln8237 could cause dependence and withdrawal symptoms, as well. it is possible that while taking this drug, you will feel changes in your mood such as a sense of euphoria (joy) or a feeling of unhappiness that could lead to depression and thoughts of hurting yourself. when stopping the drug, withdrawal symptoms could include: anxiety, restlessness, difficulty sleeping, tremors, rapid heart-beat, nausea and vomiting. since there is a possibility that this drug may cause sedation (or sleepiness), you should not drink alcoholic beverages, since alcohol can also cause sleepiness. if you feel sleepy while you are on this study, you should avoid driving or doing anything that may need your full alertness, such as operating dangerous tools or machinery. this drug may also cause sleepiness if you are currently taking an opiate such as morphine, dilaudid, or fentanyl. we will tell you if we learn any new information that may affect your health, welfare, or decision to stay in this study. for more information about risks and side effects, ask your study doctor. possible side effects of temozolomide likely less likely

rarely be a life threatening event. ** birth defects and other serious abnormalities in the unborn baby have been noted with irinotecan in animal studies at doses similar to or less than those used in humans. the timing and frequency of these effects is as yet unknown. these may include multiple birth defects and abnormalities of bone formation, small size of baby at birth and increased risk of death of the unborn baby. irinotecan is excreted in rat milk but this is unknown for humans. possible side effects of g-csf (such as neupogen, filgrastim or neulasta, pegfilgrastim) g-csf is not an

neuroblastoma a new approaches to neuroblastoma therapy (nant) treatment protocol investigator [insert name of investigator] [insert name of institution] [insert address (include city, state and zip code)] [insert telephone/fax numbers] [insert email] 1. my name is . 2. you have a kind of cancer called neuroblastoma that has either grown back or has never gone away after treatment. we are asking you to take part in a research study because doctors want to learn more about treating neuroblastoma using three medicines called mln8237, irinotecan, and temozolomide to see what effects (both good and bad) these medicines have on patients and their cancer. mln8237 is a medicine that is given by mouth as a pill (tablet). irinotecan is a medicine that is given into the bloodstream (either through your central line or through a small tube placed in a vein in your hand or arm). temozolomide is a medicine that is given by mouth, usually as a pill (capsule) though it can be given a different way if you cannot swallow capsules. the doctors think that giving these three drugs together may help get rid of neuroblastoma cancer cells. 3. if you agree to be in this study this is what will happen: the medicines will be given in cycles that each lasts 21 days. you will only get the medicine during the first 7 days of each cycle. you will continue to receive cycles of this treatment for up to 2 years unless you have bad side effects or your tumor gets worse. mln8237: you will take mln8237 by mouth once a day for the first 7 days every 21-day cycle. irinotecan: you will take irinotecan by i.v. once a day for the first 5 days every 21 day cycle. temozolomide: you will take temozolomide by mouth once a day for the first 5 days every 21-day cycle. other medicines (not chemotherapy): you may need to take other medicines to help you with side effects of the three chemotherapy medicines above. these medicines may include neupogen (given once a day as an injection) or neulasta (give each cycle as an injection) to help your normal blood cells get better after chemotherapy. to help with diarrhea, you may also take either cefixime (once per day) or cefpodoxime (twice each day) by mouth for ten days during each cycle of chemotherapy. coming to see the doctors: during and after you have finished the treatment, you will have appointments with the doctors who are taking care of you. this is called follow-up . this is to see how well the treatment has worked so far. the doctors will want to do some special tests to find this information out. they will include; blood tests (we will do this twice each week to start with, and then less often) mri, ct, and mibg scans (special pictures of your tumor) bone marrow test (to look for tumor in your bone marrow) feel your belly, look into your eyes and ears, and listen to your heart and lungs. ask you and your parents a lot of questions about how you are feeling, how you are doing in school, and any problems you might be having. you may have to come to the clinic to have blood and platelet transfusions when the blood counts are low or stay in the hospital if you have a fever with low blood counts. you will come to visit your doctor every week or so to start with, then less often if everything is going well. when you are in a research study, sometimes good things and bad things can happen 4. sometimes things happen to kids in research studies that may make them feel bad. these are called risks . some of the risks of this study are: you may feel sick to your stomach and you may throw up. you may feel tired. you may have a bad appetite. you might have a fever and maybe an infection where you will need to be in the hospital to get medicines to treat the infection. you may feel tired and weak and need a blood transfusion or you may get bruises or have bleeding (most often a nosebleed) and need a platelet transfusion. you may get sores in your mouth that make it difficult to eat and drink. if this happens, you may need some pain medicines and you may need to stay in the hospital. you may get diarrhea. the treatments may not work, and your tumor may grow, or it might come back again after the treatment has finished. if this happens we will try other ways to stop the tumor from growing. you could get a different kind of cancer, this doesn t happen often, but can happen years later. it is possible that you could die from the treatment or cancer. not all of these things may happen to you. none of these things may happen. or things may happen that the doctors don t know about yet. will we do everything possible to keep your information private. 1. things that happen to children in research studies that are good are called benefits. some of the good things for this research study could be: this treatment might make your neuroblastoma tumor stay the same size or get smaller for some time. we hope to learn more about this new treatment which could help other children with neuroblastoma. 2. please talk this over with your parents before you decide whether or not to be in this study. we will also ask your parents to give their permission for you to take part in this study. but even if your parents say yes you can still decide not to do this. 3. being in this study is up to you. you do not have to be in this study if you don t want to. you may stop being in this study at any time. 4. you can ask any questions that you have about the study. if you have a question later that you didn t think of now, you can call me or ask me next time. study doctor s phone number: . 5. special study blood tests : there are extra special tests in this study. these are done solely for research purposes only. neither you nor your doctor will know the results. #1 nine blood samples (about 8 teaspoons total) on day 1 and day 4 during the first cycle of your treatment.  yes, it is okay to take an extra blood samples  no, it is not okay to take an extra blood samples #2 one blood sample

2019-05-13,../data//eMERGE_GH_PGxConsentForm,../data//eMERGE_GH_PGxConsentForm.txt,"Project ID  (will be physically cut off after final consent reconciliation)  Consent Form  eMERGE Pharmacogenomics Study  Research Team  Group Health Research Institute    University of Washington  Eric Larson, MD, MPH    Gail Jarvik, MD, PhD  Lead researcher  Lead researcher  206-287-2534  206-221-3974    We are asking you to be in a research study. This form explains the details of the study. Please read this entire form before agreeing to join the study. If you have any questions about the study, you may contact the project manager at Group  Health Research Institute at 206-287-2150. You may also contact the researchers  listed above.    Why are we asking you to be in this study?  We are asking you to be in this study because several years ago you agreed to  give a blood sample to the Northwest Institute of Genetic Medicine Biobank. The  biobank collected blood samples and data from you and other Group Health  members to be used in future research. We also let you know then that we might  contact you in the future to tell you about about other research projects to see if you were interested. This is one such project.    We are asking you to be part of a different research study called eMERGE, which  stands for electronic Medical Records and Genomics. Group Health is one of nine sites across the country that are involved in eMERGE research. You can learn  more about this research online at http://emerge.mc.vanderbilt.edu.    You are eligible for this study because you still receive your care at Group Health.  We hope to enroll about 450 Group Health members in this study.    What is this study about?  We are doing this study to learn more about how genetic information can improve  medical care. Genetic information comes from our genes—the parts of our cells  that contain instructions for how our bodies work. Genes carry information about  traits that run in families, like blue eyes or brown eyes.    Certain differences in our genes may partly explain why some people are more  likely to get diseases like cancer, diabetes, and asthma. These differences are  called genetic variants. These genetic variants may also affect how well some  medications work for certain people. The study of how genetic variants affect a person’s response to certain medications is called “pharmacogenomics.”  In this study, we are looking at genetic variants that may affect whether:   a person needs a lower or higher dose of a medication.   a person may be more likely to have side effects with certain medications.   a certain medication will work for a person or not.    This study will also look at different ways to place genetic information into a  person’s medical record. We think this is important because it could help doctors know in advance when a certain medication may not be the best choice for a  patient. We also want to learn how patients and doctors feel about using genetic information to try to improve medical care.    What will happen if you agree to be in this study?  If you agree to be in this study, we will ask you to give us another blood sample and to let us collect some information from your Group Health medical record. We will use your blood sample to look for genetic variants that are known to affect how people respond to certain medications. We will compare results from this blood  sample with results from the blood sample you gave to the biobank several years  ago. This second test is required in order to return results for your medical care.    If we find any genetic variants that might affect how you respond to a certain  medication, we will share that information with you and your primary doctor at  Group Health. Genetic information that is relevant to your medical care may also be added to your medical record. DO NOT JOIN THIS STUDY IF YOU DO NOT  WANT GENETIC INFORMATION PUT IN YOUR MEDICAL RECORD.    Here is what you will do if you agree to participate:  1. Read and sign this consent form. Keep the yellow one for your files.  2. Check that your correct name and consumer number are on the  tubes in the enclosed blood draw package.  3. Check that the five-digit number on the tube matches the number at  the top of the first page of this consent form.  4. Mail the signed consent form and completed survey back to us in the  enclosed business reply envelope.  5. Go to your local Group Health lab for a blood draw. Please take the  enclosed blood draw package and instructions with you and give them to  the staff at the lab. The blue instruction sheet for the lab is inside the  package. The blood draw should take between 10 and 30 minutes,  depending on your wait at the Group Health lab. Your blood sample will  032-2724-2014; Version 110.0 IRBNet #486548  2  then be sent to the study’s genetic testing lab. There is no cost to you for the blood draw.    We will send you $50 as a thank you after we receive your signed consent  form and the genetic testing lab receives your blood sample. If we don’t receive your signed consent form and blood sample within a couple weeks, we  will contact you to make sure you received this mailing.    If your blood sample is not usable when it is received at the genetic testing lab, we may ask you to provide another sample. If this happens, we will send you  another $50 after the testing lab receives your second sample.    What will we do with the results of your genetic tests?  Testing your blood sample could take several months. After we complete the  testing, we will send a report to you and to your Group Health doctor. The report will only include results that might be useful for your medical care.   The report might contain positive results—meaning that we found one or  more genetic variants that could affect how you respond to certain  medications.   Or, the report might contain negative results—meaning that we found no  genetic variants known to affect how you might respond to certain  medications. A negative result does not necessarily mean that you do not  have these genetic variants. It just means that this testing didn’t find them.   The report will only contain genetic information that scientific evidence  shows may be useful for your medical care. But future research may  provide evidence about other genetic results that may be useful. If this  happens, we may send an update to you and to your doctor. But we  cannot promise that the study will have funding to do this.  Some of your genetic test results may eventually be placed in your medical  record. Currently at Group Health, there are only a few genetic tests that are being conducted and placed in patients’ medical records. These tests are mostly  related to the risks of specific diseases and are ordered by a person’s primary  care doctor. This study hopes to expand the use of genetic information by  exploring how genetic test results could be placed in medical records and used  by doctors when prescribing specific medications.   If we place your genetic test results in your medical record, it won’t  happen right away. Over the next year or two, we will develop information  and tools to help add genetic results to medical records. Only results that  are approved by Group Health as being useful for your medical care will  be placed in your medical record. After results are placed in your  record, they cannot be taken out.  032-2724-2014; Version 110.0 IRBNet #486548  3   As more research is done, Group Health may approve other tests of how genetic variants affect a person’s response to medications. If this  happens, these test results may also be included in your medical record.    How will we use your sample and information?  Your sample  Your blood sample will be labeled with your name, Group Health consumer  number, your study identification number, your birth date and the date and time  the blood was collected. This will allow us to link the sample uniquely to you.  Your sample will be sent to certified laboratories outside of Group Health for the testing, and your sample will be labeled with this information throughout the  testing process. Your results will also be labeled with your name and other  identifying information.    This is necessary because we want to return the results to you and your doctor  for use in your medical care, and possibly include some results in your medical  record. It is required by law for samples and results that are going to be used for medical care to be labeled and handled in such a way that they are linked to the  person who gave the sample and cannot be mixed up with the samples or results  of any other person. Even though the laboratories that will be doing the testing are outside of Group Health, they are bound by the same regulations that all  certified laboratories must follow in protecting your health information.    Because we want to keep the ability to return results in the future, a portion of your sample will be stored for future research in a certified laboratory at the  University of Washington, and will be labeled with your name, Group Health  consumer number, your study identification number, your birth date and the date  and time the blood was collected We may share portions of your blood sample  with other researchers for future research, but only after your identifying  information has been removed.    Your information  We will also create a research database to be used for this project and for future research studies. The research database will NOT will not have your name, or  Group Health consumer number. Your information will be identified only by your  study identification number. We will include in the research database the genetic test results from this study and analyses related to the genetic tests. We will also include health information from your Group Health medical record, including:   your medical history.   medicines you have been prescribed.   lab and other test results.   behavioral information, for example whether you have ever smoked.    032-2724-2014; Version 110.0 IRBNet #486548  4  We will collect this information from the time you joined Group Health until you are no longer a Group Health member.    In the research database, your coded information will be combined with  information from about 6,000 other study participants from health care systems  across the country. eMERGE researchers will use the database for future  studies about how a person’s genes affect their response to certain medications.  We may also share your health information with our partners at other research  sites.    Your genetic results and the health information from your medical record may be  placed into one or more national research databases, such as the “database of  Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP)” at the National Institutes of Health (NIH).  This information would include your coded genetic information and also  information about your medical history, medicines you have been prescribed, lab  and other test results and behavioral information, for example, whether you have  ever smoked. Your name and other information that could directly identify you (such as address, Group Health number, or social security number) will not be  included. But because genetic information is unique to you, there is a chance  that someone could trace it back to you.    How long will the study last?  There is no specific end date for the research being conducted using blood  samples and health information from this study. But your active role in the study will end after you complete the blood draw and the survey. However, we may  contact in you in the future to see if you would be willing to answer questions about what it was like to receive your genetic test results.    Will it cost you anything to be in this study?  There will be no costs to you for being in this study. Just as if you were not in this study, you or your insurance company are still financially responsible for your usual medical care. This includes medical procedures, exams, or other tests or  therapies not required by this study.    Will being in this study help you?  We cannot promise that being in this study will help you. But it is possible that the genetic test results we give to you and your doctor will help you make better choices about medications in the future. It may also help you avoid some  medication side effects or complications. However, you may never need any of  the medications affected by known genetic variants. In that case, being in this  study is not likely to help you personally.    032-2724-2014; Version 110.0 IRBNet #486548  5  Overall, the knowledge we gain about how genetic variants affect a person’s response to certain medications may help many people in the future.    We have no plans to use this research for commercial purposes. Researchers  using the national databank may develop and sell new medical products. If this  happens, there are no plans for you to receive any of the profits.    What are the risks of being in this study?   Blood draw: Having your blood drawn can be uncomfortable and can  sometimes cause a bruise. Some people may feel nervous or get dizzy. In  rare cases, a person may faint.     Loss of confidentiality: We take every precaution to keep your information confidential. There is still a risk that someone other than the researchers could find out you were in the study or see your private study information, and this  risk may increase in the future. The steps we take to keep this from happening  are described on the next page. Please know that once information is in your  medical record, it cannot be removed and it may be seen by others who can  request legal access (for example, social workers or attorneys).     Genetic testing: There is potential risk for genetic discrimination. Having the genetic test results in your medical record may increase the risk to your privacy.  Your insurance company may have access to this information, just as they  would any other information in your medical record. The risks of learning  genetic test results may potentially include emotional upset or insurance or job  discrimination.    A federal law, called the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA),  makes it illegal for health insurance companies, group health plans, and most  employers to discriminate against you based on your genetic information.  All health insurance companies and group health plans must follow this federal  law, which protects you in the following ways:   Health insurance companies and group health plans may not request your  genetic information that we get from this research.   Health insurance companies and group health plans may not use your  genetic information when making decisions regarding your eligibility or  premiums.   Employers with 15 or more employees may not use your genetic  information when making a decision to hire, promote, or fire you or when  setting the terms of your employment.    In keeping with the law above, Group Health does not use the genetic  information in your medical record to determine eligibility or premiums. However, 032-2724-2014; Version 110.0 IRBNet #486548  6  we cannot promise that all future insurers will not use genetic information from your medical record in some way.    Be aware that this law does not protect you against genetic discrimination by  companies that sell life insurance, disability insurance, or long-term care  insurance. Members of the U.S. military may not have the same protections  under this law. More information about GINA can be found online at  www.ginahelp.org, or you can ask a member of the research team.    How do we protect your confidentiality?  As described above, both the blood sample we collect from you and the results we  will return to you and your doctor by mail will be labeled with your name, Group  Health consumer number, your study identification number and your birth date.  This is to ensure that the results we are returning to you are really your results.  For the same reason, your sample that is stored for future research will be labeled with your name, Group Health number and other identifying information.    We are also creating a research database, to be used for this project and for future studies. In the research database your health information will be de-identified.  This means it won’t include your name, Group Health number, or other information  that is usually used to identify you. We will label your information only with a code number. We will keep the link between your name and your research code  number at Group Health and will not share it with other researchers unless you  give us permission. If the results of this study are made public, information that identifies you will not be used.    We have a Certificate of Confidentiality from the NIH. This lets us refuse to  share any study information that might identify you, even if we are asked to do so by a court of law. It is not likely that we would ever be asked to give out your identity. But because we are sharing some of your information outside of Group  Health, the Certificate serves as extra protection. The Certificate does not stop study records from being reviewed by some federal agencies. In addition, Group  Health and the funding agency may audit study records as part of study  oversight. The Certificate also does not stop you from sharing information about yourself or your part in this research.    The Certificate of Confidentiality only protects your study records. It does not protect your medical records. Genetic results that are placed in your medical  record are permanent and governed by the protections and rules that apply to  medical records.    How does HIPAA apply to this study?  Your health information is protected by a federal privacy law called the Health  Insurance Portability & Accountability ACT (HIPAA). Group Health must follow this 032-2724-2014; Version 110.0 IRBNet #486548  7  privacy law. According to HIPAA, the information collected by the researchers for this study is part of that protected health information. HIPAA requires that the researchers tell you the following:    By signing this form, you are giving Group Health permission to allow the  researchers to collect, use, and share the following information about you:  1. Your blood sample and your genetic information from the sample.  2. Your name, Group Health consumer number, and the information necessary  (date and time of blood draw, birth date, sex) to have your sample tested by  a certified laboratory and return results for possible use in your medical  care.  3. Your past, present, and future medical records, including your medical  history, medicines you have been prescribed, lab and other test results, and  behavioral information, for example whether you have ever smoked.  4. Research information collected from you as part of this study, including the  survey questions we asked you on the phone and any future surveys you  agree to do.    Who may use your health information for future research?   The Group Health and University of Washington researchers involved in this  study.   Our partners and collaborators in the eMERGE Network and other  collaborators who may become involved in the research.   Researchers using national scientific databases, such as as the “database of  Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP)”.    Who else may see your health information during this study?   The Group Health Research Institute Institutional Review Board that  oversees the research.   Your Group Health primary care provider and other Group Health doctors  involved in your clinical care.   The laboratories involved in testing and the return of test results to you and your doctor.   Federal and State agencies (such as the Food and Drug Administration, the  Department of Health and Human Services, the National Institutes of Health  and other US or government agencies in other countries) that oversee or  review research.    Your permission for the researchers to collect and share your health information  for this study will continue indefinitely unless you withdraw your permission.  032-2724-2014; Version 110.0 IRBNet #486548  8    Group Health requires that anyone who receives your health information from us  must protect your privacy. However once your information is shared outside  Group Health we cannot guarantee that it will remain private and it may no longer be protected by the Privacy Rule.  Do you have to be in this study?  No, being in this study is up to you. You are free to say no now or to leave the study at any time later. Either way, there will be no penalty. Your decision won't affect the health care you receive or benefits that you are entitled to.    Genetic tests for the medications involved in this study are available. You may  choose to pursue testing on your own. If you choose not to be in this study, your doctor will continue to make choices for medications based on the current  standards of care.    The research team can also end your participation in this study at any time  without your consent.    What happens if you change your mind later?  You may change your mind at any time. You can have existing samples destroyed  and data removed from the study research databases. If your genetic results are  already placed in your medical record, they cannot be taken out. Also if your data are already in a national databank, we may not be able to have the information  removed.

the study, you may contact the project manager at group health research institute at 206-287-2150. you may also contact the researchers listed above. why are we asking you to be in this study we are asking you to be in this study because several years ago you agreed to give a blood sample to the northwest institute of genetic medicine biobank. the biobank collected blood samples and data from you and other group health members to be used in future research. we also let you know then that we might contact you in the future to tell you about about other research projects to see if you were interested. this is one such project. we are asking you to be part of a different research study called emerge, which stands for electronic medical records and genomics. group health is one of nine sites across the country that are involved in emerge research. you can learn more about this research online at http://emerge.mc.vanderbilt.edu. you are eligible for this study because you still receive your care at group health. we hope to enroll about 450 group health members in this study. what is this study about we are doing this study to learn more about how genetic information can improve medical care. genetic information comes from our genes the parts of our cells that contain instructions for how our bodies work. genes carry information about traits that run in families, like blue eyes or brown eyes. certain differences in our genes may partly explain why some people are more likely to get diseases like cancer, diabetes, and asthma. these differences are called genetic variants. these genetic variants may also affect how well some medications work for certain people. the study of how genetic variants affect a person s response to certain medications is called pharmacogenomics. in this study, we are looking at genetic variants that may affect whether: a person needs a lower or higher dose of a medication. a person may be more likely to have side effects with certain medications. a certain medication will work for a person or not. this study will also look at different ways to place genetic information into a person s medical record. we think this is important because it could help doctors know in advance when a certain medication may not be the best choice for a patient. we also want to learn how patients and doctors feel about using genetic information to try to improve medical care. what will happen if you agree to be in this study if you agree to be in this study, we will ask you to give us another blood sample and to let us collect some information from your group health medical record. we will use your blood sample to look for genetic variants that are known to affect how people respond to certain medications. we will compare results from this blood sample with results from the blood sample you gave to the biobank several years ago. this second test is required in order to return results for your medical care. if we find any genetic variants that might affect how you respond to a certain medication, we will share that information with you and your primary doctor at group health. genetic information that is relevant to your medical care may also be added to your medical record. do not join this study if you do not want genetic information put in your medical record. here is what you will do if you agree to participate: 1. read and sign this consent form. keep the yellow one for your files. 2. check that your correct name and consumer number are on the tubes in the enclosed blood draw package. 3. check that the five-digit number on the tube matches the number at the top of the first page of this consent form. 4. mail the signed consent form and completed survey back to us in the enclosed business reply envelope. 5. go to your local group health lab for a blood draw. please take the enclosed blood draw package and instructions with you and give them to the staff at the lab. the blue instruction sheet for the lab is inside the package. the blood draw should take between 10 and 30 minutes, depending on your wait at the group health lab. your blood sample will 032-2724-2014; version 110.0 irbnet #486548 2 then be sent to the study s genetic testing lab. there is no cost to you for the blood draw. we will send you $50 as a thank you after we receive your signed consent form and the genetic testing lab receives your blood sample. if we don t receive your signed consent form and blood sample within a couple weeks, we will contact you to make sure you received this mailing. if your blood sample is not usable when it is received at the genetic testing lab, we may ask you to provide another sample. if this happens, we will send you another $50 after the testing lab receives your second sample. what will we do with the results of your genetic tests testing your blood sample could take several months. after we complete the testing, we will send a report to you and to your group health doctor. the report will only include results that might be useful for your medical care. the report might contain positive results meaning that we found one or more genetic variants that could affect how you respond to certain medications. or, the report might contain negative results meaning that we found no genetic variants known to affect how you might respond to certain medications. a negative result does not necessarily mean that you do not have these genetic variants. it just means that this testing didn t find them. the report will only contain genetic information that scientific evidence shows may be useful for your medical care. but future research may provide evidence about other genetic results that may be useful. if this happens, we may send an update to you and to your doctor. but we cannot promise that the study will have funding to do this. some of your genetic test results may eventually be placed in your medical record. currently at group health, there are only a few genetic tests that are being conducted and placed in patients medical records. these tests are mostly related to the risks of specific diseases and are ordered by a person s

Delete all red/blue directional text and asterisks before submitting.  You are being asked to participate in a research study involving the donation of embryo(s) or gametes. Donation of embryo(s) or gametes for human stem cell research purposes is completely voluntary.  Please read the information below and ask questions about anything that you do not understand before deciding if you want to participate.  A researcher listed below will be available to answer your questions.  RESEARCH TEAM AND SPONSORS  Lead Researcher:       Name and Title Department Telephone Number 24 Hour Telephone number  Other Researchers: (List only those researchers qualified to be involved in the informed consent process) Name and Title of Researcher:       Department:        Study Location(s):        Study Sponsor(s):         The following definitions may help you understand the purpose of this study: (Keep all of the definitions that apply to this study. Add other study design elements as necessary to aid understanding.)  * Blastocyst: A very early embryo consisting of approximately 100 to 150 cells. The blastocyst consists of a sphere made up of an outer layer of cells, a fluid-filled cavity, and a cluster of cells on the interior.  The cluster of cells on the interior of the blastocyst is used to derive stem cell lines. * Cell Line: A group of cells that can live and divide outside of the body; these cells can be frozen for storage for an indefinite period of time and can be used for future research. * Embryo:  The developing organism from the time of fertilization until the end of the eighth week of gestation, when it becomes known as a fetus. * Gamete:  An egg or sperm. * Human Embryonic Stem Cells:  Primitive cells derived from early human embryos that have the potential to become a wide variety of specialized cell types.  * Somatic Cells:  Any cell in the body except gametes (eggs or sperm). Skin cells are a type of somatic cells.   PURPOSE OF STUDY*	 The purpose of this research is to develop human stem cell lines from the materials and samples you have provided. Human stem cells have the unique combination of capacities to divide with no known limit and to develop into most of the different types of cells of the body. These stem cell lines will be used for basic science experimentation and may be used at some future time for human transplantation research.  This research involves donation of embryos or gametes to derive human stem cell lines for research purposes. The cells will come from very early embryos, called blastocysts, or gametes. Although the human stem cell lines can be derived from embryos, the stem cells themselves are not embryos. The stem cell lines will be used to study...(Complete this sentence. You may consider using one or more of the statements below.) * How stem cells differentiate (what molecular changes occur when cells divide in humans and animals). * How stem cells respond to drugs and other compounds to develop new therapeutic treatments for human disease and disorders.  * How stem cells may be used to create healthy tissues and cells for transplantation in humans (for example, for treating people with leukemia, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, heart disease and diabetes).

(State what the study is designed to discover or establish).  Study Design Subjects who agree to participate will... (Briefly describe the study design including the assignment of subjects to different study groups.)   PROCEDURES* If you decide to donate embryos or gametes they will be handled respectfully. The cell lines will be made and used following National Institutes of Health and National Academy of Sciences guidelines.  The cells will be cultured to grow into a human stem cell line.  The cells or cell lines created may be kept for many years and shared with other researchers.  The following procedures will occur: (Provide a detailed explanation of the research procedures in chronological order; include the expected duration of each procedure or each visit and the procedures to be completed at the visit. You may provide a visit schedule, chart, or calendar to assist the participant. Explain where the work will be conducted, the types of experiments that will be performed, whether new cell lines will be established, how they will be established, and how they will be used. Indicate that the cells may multiply indefinitely.)  If samples will be sent out of UCI for analysis or other purposes, include the statement: Your samples will be sent outside of UCI for... (Provide an explanation of where the sample will be sent and why).   RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS* If you decide to donate embryo(s) or gametes they will used to create human stem cell lines for research and may include research on human transplantation.   If you are donating embryo(s), the embryo(s) will not survive the cell line derivation process and they will not be capable of developing into a fetus.  Before deciding to donate it is strongly suggested that you reflect on the permanence of such a decision.   (List additional risks here; consider all risks such as psychological, social, economic, legal and physical.) Examples of risks include: psychological distress, invasion of privacy and possible breach of confidentiality.   UNKNOWN RISKS There may be risks to being in this study that we don't know about now.

Specimen and Data Storage (Describe how the data will be maintained.)  Examples include:  * All identifiable information about you will be removed; only a code will remain. A key will be maintained separately linking the code and your identifiable information to the research data/specimens.  * Specimens will be maintained anonymously, which means that no one, including the research team, can identify you from the specimens. * Identifiable information about you will be kept with the research data/specimens.   This information will be protected and kept confidential in the following manner: (Complete this sentence.) Examples include:  * All research data/specimens will be kept under lock and key and only authorized research team members will have access to it.   * Research data will be stored electronically on a secure network server, or on portable devices, such as a laptop with encryption (special software) and password protection.  Research Data Access (Explain who will have access to the research data - UCI Standard Language is below) The research team, authorized UCI personnel, the study sponsor (if applicable), and regulatory entities such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Office of Human Research Protections (OHRP), may have access to your study records to protect your safety and welfare.  Any information derived from this research that personally identifies you will not be voluntarily released or disclosed by these entities without your separate consent, except as specifically required by law.  Research records provided to authorized, non-UCI entities will not contain identifiable information about you. Publications and/or presentations that result from this study will not include identifiable information about you. Research data may be used by the research team or made available to other investigators. If the data/specimens are released to other investigators they will not contain any identifiable information about you (for example your name, social security or medical record number).   Specimen and Data Retention (Explain how long the specimen will be maintained. Retain the longest option that applies.) * The [indicate specimen type] and resulting cell line will be kept for approximately ___ years. * The [indicate specimen type] and resulting cell line may be frozen for an undefined period of time. * The [indicate specimen type] and resulting cell line will be maintained in a repository indefinitely. Other researchers may have access to the de-identified stem cell line for future research. * The [indicate specimen type] and resulting cell line will be kept for at least 6 years because the study involves Personal Health Information. * The researchers intend to keep the resulting cell lines for 7 years after all children enrolled in the study reach the age of majority (age 18 in California).   NEW FINDINGS* If, during the 30 day waiting period, significant new information becomes available that may relate to your willingness to continue to participate, this information will be provided to you by the research team listed at the top of the form.   OTHER CONSIDERATIONS* Use of Embryos [or Gametes] All of the [embryos or gametes-be specific] obtained for the purposes described in this consent form will become the property of the University of California, Irvine (UCI).  After 30 days the donation is irrevocable.  The [embryos or gametes - be specific] and cell lines may be frozen for an undefined period of time.   These materials will be used for research and such use may result in inventions or discoveries that could become the basis for new products or diagnostic or therapeutic agents.  In some instances, these inventions and discoveries may be of potential commercial value and may be patented and licensed by the University.  You will not receive any money or other benefits derived from any commercial or other products that may be developed from use of the donated materials.    The donation of [embryos or gametes - be specific] is made without any restriction or direction regarding who may be the recipient of transplants of the stem cells derived, should a clinical application be discovered.  The resulting stem cell lines may be used by the research team or made available to other researchers; however, the cell lines will not contain any direct identifiable information about you (for example your name, social security or medical record number).   Genetics (REQUIRED if the study involves genetic testing or access to genetic information) As part of the study, the researcher may do genetic testing or access genetic information. Genetic research is research that studies genes, including gene characteristics and gene versions that are transmitted by parents to children. Genetic research may also include genetically modifying cells that are derived from your tissues to better understand how genes function. Genetic research may include looking at information, such as personal appearance and biochemistry, gene sequences, genetic landmarks, individual and family medical histories, reactions to medication, and responses to treatment.  [Standard Template] A Federal law, called the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) generally makes it illegal for health insurance companies, group health plans, and employers of 15 or more persons to discriminate against you based on your genetic information. This means that they may not use your genetic information when making decisions regarding insurability. GINA does not, however, protect you against genetic discrimination by companies that sell life insurance, disability insurance, or long-term care insurance.  If you would like more information about GINA go to: http://www.genome.gov/Pages/PolicyEthics/GeneticDiscrimination/GINAInfoDoc.pdf.  [Alternative Template for research that involves individuals who have a diagnosis and/or are being treated for a genetic disease or disorder] A Federal law, called the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) generally makes it illegal for health insurance companies, group health plans, and employers of 15 or more persons to discriminate against individuals based on their genetic information. This means that they may not use genetic information when making decisions regarding insurability. GINA does not prohibit discrimination on the basis of an already manifest genetic disease or disorder.  This means if you have a diagnosis and/or are being treated for a genetic condition, a health insurer may use the information to determine eligibility or rates.  Also, GINA does not protect you against genetic discrimination by companies that sell life insurance, disability insurance, or long-term care insurance.  If you would like more information about GINA go to: http://www.genome.gov/Pages/PolicyEthics/Genetic Discrimination/GINAInfoDoc.pdf.    Investigator Financial Conflict of Interest* [One of the following statements is required.] No one on the study team has a significant financial interest related to this research project.                                                      OR  [A member of the study team or their spouse or dependent child(ren)-list study team members here] has a significant and related financial interest in [the Sponsor company or other related entity-list here].  The nature of this financial interest and the design of the study have been reviewed by the UCI Conflict of Interest Oversight Committee, and this committee has determined that the investigator's financial interests will not compromise the quality or reliability of the study.  Furthermore, the UCI Institutional Review Board has determined that the investigator's financial interests will not adversely affect your safety and welfare.   FUTURE RESEARCH Your embryo(s), donated specimen, cells and other materials derived from these samples may be used by other researchers at UCI or by researchers at institutions outside of UCI in future studies, which are currently undefined. They may include research that involves genetic manipulation. However, the materials will not contain any identifiable information about you (for example, it will not include your name, social security number or medical record number).  It is possible that derived cells or cell products may be placed into humans or animals. There can be no restrictions placed on the ultimate recipients of these derived cells or cell products, expect in the case where the donation is intended for autologous transplantation (where you, the donor, would also be the recipient).  The results of the study of your samples will be used for research purposes and tissue derivatives may also be used in human therapies.  You must be given the opportunity to impose restrictions on future uses of donated materials. However, researchers may choose to use materials only from donors who agree to all future uses without restrictions.   I consent to my samples [name sample type] be saved for future research.

2019-05-13,../data//206 - sample-consent-form,../data//206 - sample-consent-form.txt,"﻿Sample Consent Form  It is impossible to address all scenarios for the many types of research protocols conducted by UAB researchers. This sample is designed to assist you in the preparation of consent forms. It is intended to show language preferred by the UAB IRB to address the essential elements of informed consent. In many cases, the sample language will need to be modified, deleted, or expanded for the particular study.    Shaded paragraphs like this one are instructions for you, the writer. Do not include them in the consent form you submit. If the instructions indicate that specific language applies to your protocol, the specific language will be shown below the instructions outside of the shaded paragraph.   Use this sample consent form as a guide for obtaining consent and/or assent from participants 14 years of age and older.  Formatting Instructions * Use a 12 pt font for the consent form. * Write the consent form in the 2nd person (i.e., you) and keep the pronoun usage consistent throughout. * Use Page X of Y numbering on each page. * Leave an area approximately 1 inch by 2 inches on the bottom of the first page for the IRB approval stamp.  Use understandable, non-technical language at an 8th-grade or lower reading level. * Readability statistics can be displayed in Microsoft Word. Search Microsoft Office Help for ""readability statistics"" for further instructions.       DELETE THIS FIRST PAGE OF INFORMATION IF YOU ARE USING THIS DOCUMENT TO CREATE YOUR CONSENT FORM.   CONSENT FORM  TITLE OF RESEARCH:	Evaluation of the Safety and Efficacy of Trimycin vs. Hydrochlorothiazide in the Treatment of Hypertension  IRB PROTOCOL NO.:	F#########  INVESTIGATOR:	John Doe, Ph.D.  Sponsor: If the protocol is being sponsored by UAB departmental funds or is unfunded, put the name of the department here (e.g., UAB Department of Medicine). For student research, include the student's departmental affiliation.  If no Sponsor protocol number, remove the heading  If additional or other support is being provided, include this information with a heading such as ""SUPPORTED BY:"" after the SPONSOR line.  SPONSOR:	Wise Drug Company, Inc.  SPONSOR PROTOCOL NO.:	  RESEARCH INVOLVING CHILDREN: * When a parent or guardian is providing consent for only the child participant who will sign the assent section of the consent form, do not use ""you/your child"" throughout the form. Instead, use ""you"" and insert the following text after the SPONSOR line and before the Purpose of the Research section:  For Children (persons under 19 years of age) participating in this study, the term ""You"" addresses both the participant (""you"") and the parent or legally authorized representative (""your child"").  * When a parent or guardian is providing consent for only the child participant who will sign a separate assent form or who will not provide written assent, use ""your child"" throughout the form. * When a parent or guardian is providing consent for both him/herself and the child participant, specify throughout the consent form when you are referring to the parent and when you are referring to the child. This would allow for the use of ""you,"" ""your child,"" and ""you and your child"" throughout the form.  Purpose of the Research  * Explain the purpose of the study in nontechnical language. * Describe why the participant is being asked to join. * State that the study involves research. * If drugs or devices are used, indicate whether they are FDA approved or investigational. * If applicable, explain what a Pilot, Phase I, II, III, or IV drug study is. * State the total planned number of participants (e.g., individuals, records, specimens) to be enrolled by the UAB investigator, and studywide for multicenter studies.  We are asking you to take part in a research study. This research study will test how well a new drug lowers blood pressure. The new drug, Trimycin, is investigational and not yet approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). People who enter into the study will take either the new drug, Trimycin, or Hydrochlorothiazide (water pill). Hydrochlorothiazide is the FDA approved drug that most people take now to lower blood pressure. Trimycin is approved in Europe, but has not been approved in the United States. More than 200 people in other research studies in the United States have safely used Trimycin. This is a Phase III study. A Phase III study is a research study that looks at a large number of patients receiving a common or routine treatment. This study will enroll 200 participants nationwide, and 20 of them will come from UAB.  Explanation of Procedures  * Describe the procedures to be followed, identifying which procedures are for research and which procedures are standard of care. * Identify which procedures are experimental. * Estimate the amount of time involved in study participation. * If specimens (e.g., blood, tissue, body fluids) will be collected as part of the research procedures, describe the collection in this section. If the specimens will be stored for future research, describe the storage procedures under ""Storage of Specimens for Future Use.""  If you enter the study, all your current blood pressure medicines will be stopped for 1 month. During this time, you will be given pills called placebos. A placebo does not have any active medicine, so it should not have any effect on your blood pressure. However, this placebo might cause your blood pressure to lower. The study staff will need to watch your blood pressure closely while you are not on any medicine for your blood pressure. Your blood pressure will be watched to make sure it does not rise so high that you need immediate treatment. You will need to come for office visits three times during the first week. You will need to come for office visits two times per week during Weeks 2, 3, and 4. If your blood pressure is in the range required after Week 4, you will be entered into the study. If your blood pressure is not in the range required after Week 4, you will not be entered into the study and will receive standard care for your blood pressure. If you are entered and complete the entire study, you will be in the study for 6 months.  If you qualify for the study, you will be randomly picked (like the flip of a coin) by a computer to receive either Trimycin or Hydrochlorothiazide. You will take the medicine once a day by mouth. This will be a double-blind study. This means neither you nor your doctors will know which medicine you are taking. If medically necessary, the doctor can find out which drug you are taking.  These tests will be made during the study: lab blood tests, urine tests, weight measures, resting electrocardiogram, heart rate, and blood pressure. (An electrocardiogram measures the electrical activity of the heart.) You will be asked to come back to the clinic for 20 weekly visits. At each visit you will be asked if you have had any bad reactions and how you are feeling on the drug.  If drug screening is part of the protocol, include a statement such as:  If you have used any illicit (street) drug(s) within the past 3 months, we ask that you not participate in this project.  Where HIV testing is conducted, individuals whose test results are associated with personal identifiers must be informed of their own test results and provided the opportunity to receive appropriate counseling before and after the testing.  Where other protocol testing for reportable diseases is conducted, individuals will be informed of the results and told where to obtain counseling and referred to their primary care physician or the state health department.  Incidental Findings  If research-only imaging studies are part of the protocol, address whether or not the images will be read for incidental findings. If the images will not be read for incidental findings, include the following:  We are performing imaging solely for the research purposes described above. It is not a clinical scan intended for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes. Under no circumstance will the investigator, research staff, or imaging staff interpret the scan as normal or abnormal. They are unable to make any medical comments about your scan. The scan will not be looked at or read for any healthcare treatment or diagnostic purpose. If you want your scan to be reviewed by a physician so that the physician can look for medical issues, you can request a copy of your scan. We will provide an electronic copy at no charge.  Risks and Discomforts  * Include any foreseeable risks or discomforts to the participant (e.g., physical, social, financial, loss of employability, reputation, and breach of confidentiality). * When possible, quantify the risks involved (e.g., common, rare, percentages). * If the study involves a placebo, o define placebo (not as treatment or medication; see paragraph above that begins ""If you enter the study..."") o describe what complications may result o describe the precautions that will be taken to protect the participant during this time. * Do not include risks or discomforts associated with drugs or interventions that are not being administered or performed as part of this study.  You may have some side effects from taking these drugs. The side effects of Trimycin are headaches, feeling drowsy, and feeling tired. About forty percent (40%) of people who take Trimycin have reported feeling drowsy and tired. About twenty percent (20%) of people who take Trimycin have headaches. Hydrochlorothiazide can cause the following side effects: low blood potassium; a rise in blood uric acid and blood sugar; and a lowering of red and white blood cells. About eighty percent (80%) of people who take Hydrochlorothiazide have these problems. There may also be risks that are unknown at this time. You will be given more information if other risks are found.  Randomization: If your protocol involves randomization, include a paragraph on risks of randomization. Ensure the risks of all study arms are described in detail in this section, even if the procedures in those arms would be standard of care if the participant was not in the study. An example paragraph is below; however, you should revise as applicable to your study.    You will be assigned to a group by chance, which may prove to be less effective or to have more side effects than the other study group(s) or alternatives  Information for Women of Childbearing Potential and/or Men Capable of Fathering a Child  If applicable, include this section and address the precautions that should be taken by women of childbearing potential and/or by men capable of fathering a child before, during, and/or after participation. List the specific acceptable methods of birth control for participants involved in the study. Use only the information that is applicable to the study population.  We do not know if the study drug will affect mother's milk or an unborn fetus. Therefore, breast-feeding and pregnant women are not allowed to take part in the study. If you are pregnant or become pregnant, there may be risks to the embryo or fetus that are unknown at this time Women who can become pregnant must take a pregnancy test before the start of the study.  You should not father a child while on this study as the treatment may indirectly affect an unborn child. If you are sexually active and are at risk of causing a pregnancy, you and your female partner(s) must use a method to avoid pregnancy that works well or you must not have sex.  Unless you cannot have children because of surgery or other medical reasons, you must have been using an effective form of birth control before you start the study.  You must also agree to continue to use an effective form of birth control for 6 months after taking the study drug. Effective birth control includes birth control pills, patch, IUD, condom, sponge, diaphragm with spermicide, or avoiding sexual activity that could cause you to become pregnant.  Benefits  * State any potential benefits to the participant or to others that may reasonably be expected from the research. * Do not overstate benefits. * If there is no potential for direct benefit to the participant, that should also be stated. * Do not include medication, treatment, devices, or compensation information.  You may not benefit directly from taking part in this study. However, this study may help us better understand how to treat high blood pressure in the future.  Alternatives  * Include appropriate alternative procedures or courses of treatment that may be advantageous to the participant. * One alternative may be to not participate in the study.  There are many other drugs that are used to treat high blood pressure. Some examples of these drugs are Betasan, Enapror, and Ditserin. The investigator or research staff will discuss these other drugs with you.  Confidentiality  * Include information regarding anyone who will receive identifiable data (e.g., through subcontracts or other agreements. * Include the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) if the research involves a drug, device, or biologic subject to FDA oversight.  Information obtained about you for this study will be kept confidential to the extent allowed by law. However, research information that identifies you may be shared with the UAB Institutional Review Board (IRB) and others who are responsible for ensuring compliance with laws and regulations related to research, including people on behalf of [ADD SPONSOR NAME] and the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP). The information from the research may be published for scientific purposes; however, your identity will not be given out.  Permanent Medical Record: If the consent form will be placed in the participant's permanent medical record at University of Alabama Hospital and/or Children's of Alabama, include the following:  If any part of this study takes place at     [UAB ONLY] University of Alabama Hospital    [Children's ONLY] Children's of Alabama [UAB & Children's] University of Alabama Hospital and Children's of Alabama  this consent document will be placed in your file at that facility. The document will become part of your medical record chart.  Billing Compliance Language: Only if ""clinical billable services"" will be provided at a UAB Health System location (i.e. HSF Clinics, UAB Hospital, UAB Highlands, or Callahan Eye Foundation) or Children's of Alabama, include the language below, as applicable. If you have questions about UAB's clinical trial billing, contact the Fiscal Approval Process (FAP) staff at FAP@uab.edu. For details on submission requirements, go to http://www.uab.edu/osp/fiscal-approval-process-fap. If you have questions about clinical trial billing for studies conducted at Children's of Alabama, contact Pam Barlow at pam.barlow@childrensal.org or 558-2452.  Information relating to this study, including your name, medical record number, date of birth and social security number, may be shared with the billing offices of      [UAB ONLY] UAB and UAB Health System affiliated entities    [Children's ONLY] Children's of Alabama and its billing agents [UAB & Children's] UAB and UAB Health System affiliated entities, along with Children's of Alabama and its billing agents  so that the costs for clinical services can be appropriately paid for by either the study account or by the patient/patient's insurance.  Clinical Trials:  Include the following language for all clinical trials.  Click here  to determine if your protocol meets UAB's definition of clinical trial.  Your medical record will indicate that you are on a clinical trial and will provide the name and contact information for the principal investigator.  International Protocols: Only if the study is conducted outside the United States or sponsored by a company based outside the United States and foreign regulatory agencies will have access to identifiable research records, include the following:  Monitors, auditors, the Institutional Review Board for Human Use, and regulatory authorities will be granted direct access to your original medical records for verification of trial procedures and/or data without violating confidentiality.  ClinicalTrials.gov: For applicable clinical trials, include the statement below. It is the responsibility of the sponsors and investigators to determine if their clinical trial meets the definition of an ""applicable clinical trial"" and to ensure compliance with the most current applicable statutory and regulatory requirements. If you have any questions regarding registering a study on ClinicalTrials.gov, contact Penny Jester at 934-2424 or pjester@uab.edu.  A description of this clinical trial will be available on http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov, as required by U.S. Law. This Web site will not include information that can identify you. At most, the Web site will include a summary of the results. You can search this Web site at any time.  Reportable Diseases/Conditions: Only if the investigator will be testing for any reportable diseases/conditions, include a statement specifying what reportable diseases/conditions are being tested and that positive results will be reported to the county or state health department.  Screening for Drugs, Observations of Abusive Behavior: Only if the investigator will conduct drug screening or inquire about abusive behavior (e.g., child or elder abuse or neglect, or harm to self) as part of the protocol, include the following statement:  Information obtained during the course of the study which, in the opinion of the investigator(s), suggests that you may be at significant risk of harm to yourself or others will be reportable to a third party in the interest of protecting the rights and welfare of those at potential risk.  Genetic Research: Only if the research involves genetic testing, describe the protections provided to the participant under GINA. For questions regarding GINA, see the IRB Guidebook. The following may be used for the description:  A federal law, called the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA), generally makes it illegal for health insurance companies, group health plans, and most employers to discriminate against you based on your genetic information. This law generally will protect you in the following ways:  * Health insurance companies and group health plans may not request your genetic information that we get from this research. * Health insurance companies and group health plans may not use your genetic information when making decisions regarding your eligibility or premiums. * Employers with 15 or more employees may not use your genetic information that we get from this research when making a decision to hire, promote, or fire you or when setting the terms of your employment.  Be aware that this new federal law does not protect you against genetic discrimination by companies that sell life insurance, disability insurance, or long-term care insurance, nor does it protect you against genetic discrimination by all employers.  Voluntary Participation and Withdrawal  * Include the consequences of a participant's decision to withdraw from the research. * Include procedures for orderly termination of participation by the participant.   Whether or not you take part in this study is your choice. There will be no penalty if you decide not to be in the study. If you decide not to be in the study, you will not lose any benefits you are otherwise owed. You are free to withdraw from this research study at any time. Your choice to leave the study will not affect your relationship with this institution. However, you should return to see the study doctor for safety reasons so you can be taken off the study drug and referred for follow-up care.  * If applicable, include anticipated circumstances under which the PI without regard to the participant's consent may terminate the participant's involvement (An example paragraph is below; however, you should revise as applicable to your study.).  You may be removed from the study without your consent if the sponsor ends the study, if the study drug is approved by the FDA, if the study doctor decides it is not in the best interest of your health, or if you are not following the study rules.  If students or employees of UAB may participate in the study, the IRB recommends using the following language in the consent form:  If you are a UAB student or employee, taking part in this research is not a part of your UAB class work or duties.  You can refuse to enroll, or withdraw after enrolling at any time before the study is over, with no effect on your class standing, grades, or job at UAB. You will not be offered or receive any special consideration if you take part in this research.  Cost of Participation  * If any costs to the participant or the participant's health insurance might result from the research (e.g., for tests, drugs, biologics, devices, or copayments), describe those costs. Include information about any financial assistance that may be available, such as how to consult a social worker. * If there is no cost to the participant, this should be stated.  There will be no cost to you for taking part in this study. All drugs, exams, and medical care related to this study will be provided to you at no cost during the 6-month study period.  If standard medical care may be provided during the study include the following statement:  The costs of your standard medical care will be billed to you and/or your insurance company in the usual manner.  If participants may be enrolled in Medicare Advantage and will have study related services billed to their Medicare Advantage insurance, include the following statement. If you have questions regarding the inclusion of this statement, contact the Fiscal Approval Process (FAP) staff at FAP@uab.edu.  If you are in Medicare Advantage (Medicare managed care plan), you should contact someone at your plan before you start a clinical trial. They can provide more information about additional costs you could incur from participating in clinical trials.  Category B Medical Devices:  If a Category B medical device is used in the study, include the following statement:  Your insurance company may or may not pay for the device(s) used in this study.  Blue Cross Blue Shield of Alabama will not pay for Category B medical devices.  Other insurance companies may also decline to cover these types of devices.  Therefore, it is very important that you provide your current health insurance information to UAB and that you check with your insurance company about the costs of participation.

UAB and Wise Drug Company, Inc. have not provided for any payment if you are harmed as a result of taking part in this study. If such harm occurs, treatment will be provided. However, this treatment will not be provided free of charge.  * For sponsored research where the sponsor(s) will pay participants for either compensation or treatment for research-related injuries, include the specific language provided by the sponsor(s) regarding injury compensation. The IRB must be provided with ""sponsor verification"" either in the form of a letter signed by the sponsor(s) with the same wording given in the consent form or a model consent form included in the protocol and listed in the Table of Contents of the protocol with the same wording. Do not submit a copy of the indemnification letter as the verification. Include information regarding what medical treatment will consist of if injury occurs and where further information may be obtained.  Significant New Findings  Indicate that significant new findings developed during the course of the research that may relate to the participant's willingness to continue participation will be provided to the participant by the principal investigator or his/her staff.  You will be told by your doctor or the study staff if new information becomes available that might affect your choice to stay in the study.  Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS)  For protocols that are considered Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS), UAB must certify that plans for the submission of genotype and phenotype data from GWAS to the NIH meet the expectations of the policy. See the IRB Guidebook for more information on what should be submitted for this certification. For applicable protocol, include the following:  The DNA that composes your genes will be analyzed and that data, which is referred to as your genotype or complete genetic makeup, will be compared to your phenotype, which consists of your observable traits, characteristics, and diseases. Your genotype and phenotype data will be shared for research purposes through the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) data repository. The aim of this research is to discover genetic factors that contribute to the development, progression, or therapy for a particular disease or trait.  Questions  * Include the name of the Principal Investigator and his/her contact number for participants to contact regarding the research and research-related injuries. * Include the names of additional contact personnel, if applicable.

Legal Rights  You are not waiving any of your legal rights by signing this informed consent document.  Storage of Specimens for Future Use  If specimens (e.g., blood, tissue) obtained for the research may be stored for future research not specifically defined in the protocol, place this section after Legal Rights and before Signatures. At a minimum, address the following points and include lines for participants to initial (do not use checkboxes): * What kind of specimens will be collected and the means of collection * What type of research will be done with the specimens * Whether the specimens will be shared with other investigators * Whether the specimens will be coded or anonymized (no way of tracing back to participant/uncoded or code destroyed) * Whether the participant may be contacted for additional consent * How long, if known, the biological specimens will be stored (short- term: current protocol only or other current research; Long-term: future studies on disease or condition, repository, etc.) * Foreseeable risks or benefits to participants in the collection, storage, and subsequent research use of specimens * What will be done with the biological specimens if the participant refuses permission * What will be done with the research results (research results should not be placed in the individual participant's medical record) * Potential for commercial use of the subject's specimen(s) * How to withdraw consent for future use  As part of this study, we would like to store some of the blood and urine specimens collected from you for future research on hypertension. The future research may be conducted by Dr. John Doe or by other researchers that obtain IRB approval for their research. The specimens will be labeled with a code that only Dr. John Doe can link back to you. Results of any future research will not be given to you or your doctor. The specimens obtained from you in this research may help in the development of a future commercial product. There are no plans to provide financial compensation to you should this occur.  You do not have to agree to allow your blood and urine specimens to be stored in order to be part of this study.  You may request at any time that your research samples be removed from storage and not be used for future research. If you decide you want your samples removed, you may contact Dr. John Doe at the University of Alabama at Birmingham at 205-934-3810. Once the request is received, and if your samples have not already been used for other research, they will be destroyed. If you do not make such a request, your specimens will be stored indefinitely or until used.  Initial your choice below:  ___ I agree to allow my samples to be kept and used for future research on hypertension.  ___ I do not agree to allow my samples to be kept and used for future research.   Signatures  * Should be in third person (i.e., you). * The signature only indicates agreement to participate; do not include other attestations (e.g., I have had all my questions asked, etc.).   Your signature below indicates you that you have read (or been read) the information provided above and agree to participate in this study. You will receive a copy of this signed consent form.  or  You are making a decision whether or not to have your child participate in this study. Your signature indicates that you have read (or been read) the information provided above and decided to allow your child to participate.  It is impossible to address all scenarios for signature requirements that may be needed for various types of research. These instructions and samples are designed to assist you in the preparation of the Signatures section. In many cases, the Signatures section will need to be customized for the particular study population.  * The requirements for signature lines depend upon the consent process described in the Human Subjects Protocol. * Each signature-date line included in the Signatures section, as applicable to the research, must be signed and dated. * All signatures must appear on the same page, but that page does not need to be a separate page with no other information. * Each person who signs the consent form must include the date of his/her signature. * If the research involves children (i.e., individuals younger than 19 years of age for research conducted in the state of Alabama), see ""Children"" under General Information in the IRB Guidebook and see Example Signatures for Research Involving Children, below. * If the research involves pregnant women, see ""Pregnant Women, Fetuses, Neonates"" under General Information in the IRB Guidebook. * A signature-date line for the participant must be included. The acceptable options are shown and described below.    Option 1  													 Signature of Participant								Date  Option 2  Legally Authorized Representatives (LAR) * If the research proposes to obtain consent from the participant or the LAR, add ""(or Legally Authorized Representative)"" after ""Signature of Participant."" * If the research proposes to obtain consent from the participant and the LAR, include a separate signature-date line for each person. * If an individual is not capable of providing informed consent, the IRB allows that it may be obtained from the individuals listed below in priority order: o Judicially appointed guardian or individual named in a durable power of attorney; o Spouse; o Sons or daughters 19 years of age or older; o Either parent; o Brother or Sister 19 years of age or older; o Other nearest kin 19 years of age or older.

In some instances, the consent of a guardian may be used in lieu of parental consent. A guardian is an individual who is authorized under applicable state or local law to consent on behalf of a child to general medical care. For purposes of research conducted in Alabama a guardian is: 1. A person appointed guardian of a child pursuant to the Alabama Uniform Guardianship and Protective Proceedings Act (Code of Alabama, Title 26) as documented by a valid court order; 2. A person having legal custody of a child and as documented by court order; 3. A person acting in loco parentis, regardless of whether such is documented by a court order. A person acts in loco parentis of a child where the individual voluntarily assumes responsibility for the child's custody, care, and maintenance even though no court order exists formally appointing the person as the guardian, legal custodian, or adoptive parent of the child. If such individuals may provide permission for the enrollment of children, the Human Subjects Protocol must explain how the investigator will confirm the in loco parentis relationship.  Other Signature Lines  Principal Investigator * All persons who discuss or obtain informed consent must be listed in the HSP. * If the principal investigator is not the only person who will conduct informed consent discussions and obtain signatures, add ""or Other Person Obtaining Consent"" after ""Signature of Principal Investigator."" * If the Principal Investigator will never obtain informed consent, this signature-date line should be labeled ""Signature of Person Obtaining Informed Consent.""   													 Signature of Principal Investigator							Date  Witness * Include this line unless the PI requests and justifies, and the IRB approves a waiver of the witness requirement. * The person administering the consent (e.g., study coordinator) cannot sign as the witness.

the participant is being asked to join. * state that the study involves research. * if drugs or devices are used, indicate whether they are fda approved or investigational. * if applicable, explain what a pilot, phase i, ii, iii, or iv drug study is. * state the total planned number of participants (e.g., individuals, records, specimens) to be enrolled by the uab investigator, and studywide for multicenter studies. we are asking you to take part in a research study. this research study will test how well a new drug lowers blood pressure. the new drug, trimycin, is investigational and not yet approved by the u.s. food and drug administration (fda). people who enter into the study will take either the new drug, trimycin, or hydrochlorothiazide (water pill). hydrochlorothiazide is the fda approved drug that most people take now to lower blood pressure. trimycin is approved in europe, but has not been approved in the united states. more than 200 people in other research studies in the united states have safely used trimycin. this is a phase iii study. a phase iii study is a research study that looks at a large number of patients receiving a common or routine treatment. this study will enroll 200 participants nationwide, and 20 of them will come from uab. explanation of procedures * describe the procedures to be followed, identifying which procedures are for research and which procedures are standard of care. * identify which procedures are experimental. * estimate the amount of time involved in study participation. * if specimens (e.g., blood, tissue, body fluids) will be collected as part of the research procedures, describe the collection in this section. if the specimens will be stored for future research, describe the storage procedures under ""storage of specimens for future use."" if you enter the study, all your current blood pressure medicines will be stopped for 1 month. during this time, you will be given pills called placebos. a placebo does not have any active medicine, so it should not have any effect on your blood pressure. however, this placebo might cause your blood pressure to lower. the study staff will need to watch your blood pressure closely while you are not on any medicine for your blood pressure. your blood pressure will be watched to make sure it does not rise so high that you need immediate treatment. you will need to come for office visits three times during the first week. you will need to come for office visits two times per week during weeks 2, 3, and 4. if your blood pressure is in the range required after week 4, you will be entered into the study. if your blood pressure is not in the range required after week 4, you will not be entered into the study and will receive standard care for your blood pressure. if you are entered and complete the entire study, you will be in the study for 6 months. if you qualify for the study, you will be randomly picked (like the flip of a coin) by a computer to receive either trimycin or hydrochlorothiazide. you will take the medicine once a day by mouth. this will be a double-blind study. this means neither you nor your doctors will know which medicine you are taking. if medically necessary, the doctor can find out which drug you are taking. these tests will be made during the study: lab blood tests, urine tests, weight measures, resting electrocardiogram, heart rate, and blood pressure. (an electrocardiogram measures the electrical activity of the heart.) you will be asked to come back to the clinic for 20 weekly visits. at each visit you will be asked if you have had any bad reactions and how you are feeling on the drug. if drug screening is part of the protocol, include a statement such as: if you have used any illicit (street) drug(s) within the past 3 months, we ask that you not participate in this project. where hiv testing is conducted, individuals whose test results are associated with personal identifiers must be informed of their own test results and provided the opportunity to receive appropriate counseling before and after the testing. where other protocol testing for reportable diseases is conducted, individuals will be informed of the results and told where to obtain counseling and referred to their primary care physician or the state health department. incidental findings if research-only imaging studies are part of the protocol, address whether or not the images will be read for incidental findings. if the images will not be read for incidental findings, include the following: we are performing imaging solely for the research purposes described above. it is not a clinical scan intended for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes. under no circumstance will the investigator, research staff, or imaging staff interpret the scan as normal or abnormal. they are unable to make any medical comments about your scan. the scan will not be looked at or read for any healthcare treatment or diagnostic purpose. if you want your scan to be reviewed by a physician so that the physician can look for medical issues, you can request a copy of your scan. we will provide an electronic copy at no charge. risks and discomforts * include any foreseeable risks or discomforts to the participant (e.g., physical, social, financial, loss of employability, reputation, and breach of confidentiality). * when possible, quantify the risks involved (e.g., common, rare, percentages). * if the study involves a placebo, o define placebo (not as treatment or medication; see paragraph above that begins ""if you enter the study..."") o describe what complications may result o describe the precautions that will be taken to protect the participant during this time. * do not include risks or discomforts associated with drugs or interventions that are not being administered or performed as part of this study. you may have some side effects from taking these drugs. the side effects of trimycin are headaches, feeling drowsy, and feeling tired. about forty percent (40%) of people who take trimycin have reported feeling drowsy and tired. about twenty percent (20%) of people who take trimycin have headaches. hydrochlorothiazide can cause the following side effects: low blood potassium; a rise in blood uric acid and blood sugar; and a lowering of red and white blood cells. about eighty percent (80%) of people who take hydrochlorothiazide have these problems. there may also be risks that are unknown at this time. you will be given more information if other risks are found. randomization: if your protocol involves randomization, include a paragraph on risks of randomization. ensure the risks of all study arms are described in detail in this section, even if the procedures in those arms would be standard of care if the participant was not in the study. an example paragraph is below; however, you should revise as applicable to your study. you will be assigned to a group by chance, which may prove to be less effective or to have more side effects than the other study group(s) or alternatives information for women of childbearing potential and/or men capable of fathering a child if applicable, include this section and address the precautions that should be taken by women of childbearing potential and/or by men capable of fathering a child before, during, and/or after participation. list the specific acceptable methods of birth control for participants involved in the study. use only the information that is applicable to the study population. we do not know if the study drug will affect mother's milk or an unborn fetus. therefore, breast-feeding and pregnant women are not allowed to take part in the study. if you are pregnant or become pregnant, there may be risks to the embryo or fetus that are unknown at this time women who can become pregnant must take a pregnancy test before the start of the study. you should not father a child while on this study as the treatment may indirectly affect an unborn child. if you are sexually active and are at risk of causing a pregnancy, you and your female partner(s) must use a method to avoid pregnancy that works well or you must not have sex. unless you cannot have children because of surgery or other medical reasons, you must have been using an effective form of birth control before you start the study. you must also agree to continue to use an effective form of birth control for 6 months after taking the study drug. effective birth control includes birth control pills, patch, iud, condom, sponge, diaphragm with spermicide, or avoiding sexual activity that could cause you to become pregnant. benefits * state any potential benefits to the participant or to others that may reasonably be expected from the research. * do not overstate benefits. * if there is no potential for direct benefit to the participant, that should also be stated. * do not include medication, treatment, devices, or compensation information. you may not benefit directly from taking part in this study. however, this study may help us better understand how to treat high blood pressure in the future. alternatives * include appropriate alternative procedures or courses of treatment that may be advantageous to the participant. * one alternative may be to not participate in the study. there are many other drugs that are used to treat high blood pressure. some examples of these drugs are betasan, enapror, and ditserin. the investigator or research staff will discuss these other drugs with you. confidentiality * include information regarding anyone who will receive identifiable data (e.g., through subcontracts or other agreements. * include the us food and drug administration (fda) if the research involves a drug, device, or biologic subject to fda oversight. information obtained about you for this study will be kept confidential to the extent allowed by law. however, research information that identifies you may be shared with the uab institutional review board (irb) and others who are responsible for ensuring compliance with laws and regulations related to research, including people on behalf of [add sponsor name] and the office for human research protections (ohrp). the information from the research may be published for scientific purposes; however, your identity will not be given out. permanent medical record: if the consent form will be placed in the participant's permanent medical record at university of alabama hospital and/or children's of alabama, include the following: if any part of this study takes place at [uab only] university of alabama hospital [children's only] children's of alabama [uab & children's] university of alabama hospital and children's of alabama this consent document will be placed in your file at

information obtained during the course of the study which, in the opinion of the investigator(s), suggests that you may be at significant risk of harm to yourself or others will be reportable to a third party in the interest of protecting the rights and welfare of those at potential risk. genetic research: only if the research involves genetic testing, describe the protections provided to the participant under gina. for questions regarding gina, see the irb guidebook. the following may be used for the description: a federal law, called the genetic information nondiscrimination act (gina), generally makes it illegal for health insurance companies, group health plans, and most employers to discriminate against you based on your genetic information. this law generally will protect you in the following ways: * health insurance companies and group health plans may not request your genetic information that we get from this research. * health insurance companies and group health plans may not use your genetic information when making decisions regarding your eligibility or premiums. * employers with 15 or more employees may not use your genetic information that we get from this research when making a decision to hire, promote, or fire you or when setting the terms of your employment. be aware that this new federal law does not protect you against genetic discrimination by companies that sell life insurance, disability insurance, or long-term care insurance, nor does it protect you against genetic discrimination by all employers. voluntary participation and withdrawal * include the consequences of a participant's decision to withdraw from the research. * include procedures for orderly termination of participation by the participant. whether or not you take part in this study is your choice. there will be no penalty if you decide not to be in the study. if you decide not to be in the study, you will not lose any benefits you are otherwise owed. you are free to withdraw

(e.g., i have had all my questions asked, etc.). your signature below indicates you that you have read (or been read) the information provided above and agree to participate in this study. you will receive a copy of this signed consent form. or you are making a decision whether or not to have your child participate in this study. your signature indicates that you have read (or been read) the information provided above and decided to allow your child to participate. it is impossible to address all scenarios for signature requirements that may be needed for various types of research. these instructions and samples are designed to assist you in the preparation of the signatures section. in many cases, the signatures section will need to be customized for the particular study population. * the requirements for signature lines depend upon the consent process described in the human subjects protocol. * each signature-date line included in the signatures section, as applicable to the research, must be signed and dated. * all signatures must appear on the same page, but that page does not need to be a separate page with no other information. * each person who signs the consent form must include the date of his/her signature. * if the research involves children (i.e., individuals younger than 19 years of age for research conducted in the state of alabama), see ""children"" under general information in the irb guidebook and see example signatures for research involving children, below. * if the research involves pregnant women, see ""pregnant women, fetuses, neonates"" under general information in the irb guidebook. * a signature-date line for the participant must be included. the acceptable options are shown and described below. option 1 													 signature of participant								date option 2 legally authorized representatives (lar) * if the research proposes to obtain consent from the participant or the lar, add ""(or legally authorized representative)"" after ""signature of participant."" * if the research proposes to obtain consent from the participant and the lar, include a separate signature-date line for each person. * if an individual is not capable of providing informed consent, the irb allows that it may be obtained from the individuals listed below in priority order: o judicially appointed guardian or individual named in a durable

needs to be documented for participants under 7 years of age, but these participants should be included in the consent process if possible. o a separate assent form should be prepared for use with, and to document the assent of, participants who are 7-13 years old. o participants 14-18 years old document their assent by signing the main consent form. * if the irb determines the permission of only one parent or guardian is necessary, only include one line for ""signature of parent or guardian"" below. * a parent, for purposes of consent, means either a child's biological or adoptive parent. in some instances, the consent of a guardian may be used in lieu of parental consent. a guardian is an individual who is authorized under applicable state or local law to consent on behalf of a child to general medical care. for purposes of research conducted in alabama a guardian is: 1. a person appointed guardian of a child pursuant to the alabama uniform guardianship and protective proceedings act (code of alabama, title 26) as documented by a valid court order; 2. a person having legal custody of a child and as documented by court order; 3. a person acting in loco parentis, regardless of whether such is documented by a court order. a person acts in loco parentis of a child where the individual voluntarily assumes responsibility for the child's custody, care, and maintenance even though no court order exists formally appointing the person as the guardian, legal custodian, or adoptive parent of the child. if such individuals may provide permission for the enrollment of children, the human subjects protocol must explain how the investigator will confirm the in loco parentis relationship. other signature lines principal investigator * all persons who discuss or obtain informed consent must be listed in the hsp. * if the principal investigator is not the only person who will conduct informed consent discussions and obtain signatures, add ""or other person obtaining consent"" after ""signature of principal investigator."" * if the principal investigator will never obtain informed consent, this signature-date line should be labeled ""signature of person obtaining informed consent."" 													 signature of principal investigator							date witness * include this line unless the pi requests and justifies, and the irb approves a waiver of the witness requirement. * the person administering the consent (e.g., study coordinator) cannot sign as the witness. 													 signature of witness									date reviewed by include this line only if

You have been asked to participate in this research because you are over the age of 50, you receive your  healthca1V at Marshfield Clinic and you may someday be prescribed a medication of intetest to our  lesearch pmject. There are 7 sites involved with the eMERGE research network,  bttps;//www.me.vanderbilt.edu/victr,qcg/proiects/acc'index.php/M4in Pakg, and the goal is to enroll  about 750 people for this lesearch project at each site.  Why is this research study being done?  This research is being done to better understand how genetic information can affect medical care of  patients. You are invited to take part in a lesearch study funded by the National Human Genome Resealeh  Institute (NHGRI), Pharmacogenom ics Research Network (PGRN) and the Marshfield Clinic Research  Foundation. The pumose of this research project is to establish a group of 750 people seen at Marshfield  Cl inic who will contribute to a research effort to help us learn more about genetics and response to  medications known as Pharmacogenomics.  Pharmacogenomics is the study of how an individual's genetics (DNA) affects the body's response to  drugs. It is the hope that drugs might one day be chosen for individuals based on each person's genetic  makeup. Environment, diet, age, lifestyle, and state of health all can influence a person's response to  medicines. However, understanding an individual's genetic makeup is thought to be key to prescribing  drugs that work better and are safer for you.  The future hope is for doctors to analyze a patient's genetic profile and prescribe the best available drug  therapy. Not only will this take the guesswork out of finding the right drug, it will speed recovery time  and Increase safety as the likelihood of adverse reactions is reduced. Pharmacogenom ics has the potential  to d17matically reduce the estimated 100,000 deaths and 2 million hospitalizations each year in the United  States as the result of negative drug response.  Taking part in this study is voluntary. Whether you decide to take part in this research is completely up to  you. Read the following information carefully before you make a decision. In writing this consent form,  some technical words were necessary. Please ask for an explanation of any you do not understand. Ask  the study doctor or staff as many questions as you wish about this consent form and what will happen to  you as part of this research.  IRB Approved — October l, 2012   ****** Result for Image/Page 2 ****** Consent Form — BR110412  Page 2 of 7  What will happen if you agree to be in this research study?  If you aglee to be in this lesearch study, you will be asked to do the following:  You will be asked to meet with a lesearch coordinator to discuss the project in depth. This will be in  person at Marshfield Clinic. We will discuss the Infolmed Consent and explain why we are conducting  this project, the risks, benefits, alternatives and responsibilities. We will answer all your questions about  the project. If you choose to panicipate, we will require a signed IIIPAA Privacy form and an Informed  Consent.  You will be asked to complete a shon questionnaire. This questionnaire will help us understand how  people look at and feel about genetics. This will also help researchers understand how genetics (your  genes) influence the way specific drugs may work for you and for other people. A follow-up  questionnaire may be sent to you in the future to complete.  You will be asked for a blood sample. A trained Marshfield Clinic Phlebotomist will draw 2 vials (2  tablespoons) of blood. The DNA, or genetic part, will be taken from your blood and sent to a clinically  certified (CLIA) laboratory at Marshfield Clinic or off-site for analysis. About 84 genes will be genotyped  or looked at. These genes ale consideæd high impact pharmacogenetic genes. This means variants or  variations in these genes are either known or thought to be important in drug effectiveness, drug dosing or  adverse outcomes. We will add certain information about your DNA genetic results in your medical  records.  We will add this clinically important genetic information regarding these variants into your medical  IVcords. We will work with your Marshfield Clinic physician with the goal of having your doctor use this  information for medications if they are someday prescribed to you. This knowledge will be very  beneficial to your doctor with regards to dosing, efficacy and potential adverse ptoblems.  Initially, this data will bc limited to 3 drugs: Plavix (medication for heart stents), Warfarin (blood thinner)  and Simvastatin (cholesterol lowering medication). As we improve knowledge and ability to link more  genetic variants with other drugs, data will be expanded to include other drugs that may affect your  healthcare and prescribing of these other medications. This information will include genetic variants  recognized by the FDA or other experts regarding specific drugs. We will store the rest of your genetic  information in the research warehouse for future use. 'I-hese data may be used for additional  pharmacogenetic research. Periodically, when new FDA warnings are discovered, we may update your  medical record with information on how you may react to diffetent drugs.  This study may find you have one or more genetic risk factors that we were not looking for. These  conditions may be uutable, therefore you and your healthcare provider should know about them. An  example of such a clinically relevant variant is a condition called malignant hypelthermia. This condition  is more common in Wisconsin, and can result in serious complications if cenain types of anesthesia are  given prior to surgery. If one of these variants is noted to be present in your genetic make-up, we will  inform you and your healthcare provider. This information will be placed in your medical record.  Clinical and Scientific experts will help decide which genetic variants may requile clinical attention. If  any such variants are found in your DNA, you and your primary health care provider will be sent a letter  informing you or these results. However, you and/or your insurance provider will be responsible for any  costs associated with clinical follow-up related to this genetic information. It is important that you  notify study staff and/or your primary care provider if your contact information changes.  IRB Approved  - October 11, 2012   ****** Result for Image/Page 3 ****** Consent Form - BR110412  Page 3 of 7  Research staff Will have access to your medical record. Selected information from your medical record  Will be used to learn more about genetic variants and pharmacogenomics. Your medical will be  used to help us look at medication use and the effects it has on different people. This will continue  throughout the project. Clinically important information may be added to your medical record during this  project.  What are the possible risks or discomforts from being in this study?  Blood Draw Risks: There is always a risk when having blood taken from a vein. This blood draw will not  be any different than the blood draw for normal clinical labs. Risks associated with blood draws include  the potential for minor pain and slight bruising. There is a very small chance of infection at the site where  the blood was drawn. Some people may faint when their blood is drawn.  Genetic Testing: Risks of learning genetic test results may include emotional upset or insurance or job  discrimination.  Confidentiality Risk: Clinically relevant genetic information will be put into your medical This  information will be tteated the same as other medical information in your medical record. All records and  materials that identify you will be ueated as confidential.  Remaining genetic information that will not currently be used outside of your medical records will be  stored on a secure computer system. A limited number of approved researchers and staff have access to  the database. Few individuals will have access to the codes that link your identity to the data and all  people working With your data are required to protect your privacy.  Although remote, there is a risk that information about your genetic make-up may be accidentally  leleased to you or others. Researchers will take steps outlined in this consent form to protect your genetic  information. However, only selected clinically relevant genetic information will be placed in your  medical lecords for medication use and dosage.  This researvll may also involve risks or discomforts that are now not known.  What are possible benefits from being in this research study?  This study may not improve your health. However, the information added to your medical record from  this lesearch project may help your health care provider make better prescription drug choices for you.  This may help you avoid some prescription drug-related side effects or complications. You may never  need any of the medications we are studying and this information may provide no benefit to you.  Will you be paid for taking part in this research study?  You will not wceive compensation or reimbursement for participation in this project.

There is no specific end time since this study will build resources at Marshfield Clinic to incorporate  genetic information into clinical care. This information will be placed in your medical records [or your  doctor to use for your future medicat care. Therefore, there is no intention to end the study. You arc  agreeing to part of ongoing research surrounding genetic and drug related infonnation at Marshfield  Clinic. At some point in time, Marshfield Clinic Pharmacy and medical protessionals may determine that  use of specific genetic variants related to prescription drugs is part of regular clinical care. At that time,  your genetic information may no longer be considered part of IVsea1Vh, but instead, part of clinical care.  You will be told of any new findings regarding this research that may affect your willingness to be in this  study  Will there be a cost to you to take part in this research study?  Neither you nor your insurance company will get billed for study-related procedures.  Who will have access to my data?  Your Marshfield Clinic primary doctor will have access to the clinically important information added to  your medical records. The goal is having your doctor use this information for medications if they are  someday prescribed to you.  Approved researchers and staff will have access to your research data.  Your coded research data may be shared with researchers outside of the Marshfield Clinic. Outside  researchers could include other hospitals, medical schools, universities, research institutions and  companies. Drug companies may use this to study how their drugs work and how different people  respond. This shared information will have a coded number and will not include your name or any other  identifying information. Researchers will be able to see selected medical information about you but will  not have any way of knowing your name.  Databases ate being developed to help funher medical We will share coded data with these  types of databases. One example of this type of database is called ""dbGaP"" (short for ""Database  Genotype and Phenotype""). This database has been set up by the National Institutes of Health.

However, your  identity Will not be made known.  Fedeml and state laws exist which provide individuals with a variety of protections against genetic-based  discrimination either by employers or by health insurers.  Wisconsin state law was enacted in 1991 and applies to employers, labor unions, employment agencies,  licensing agencies, health insurers and self-funded insurance plans sponsored by local government. These  groups may not require or even Jequest that you obtain a genetic test; or if a genetic test is obtained,  disclose the fact that a test was taken or ask for test results  The Genetic Information Non-discrimination Act (GINA) applies to health insurance companies and  group health plans, and employers with 15 or more employees. Under the terms of the act, these groups  may not:  a Request genetic information collected as part or research; or  o Use your genetic information when making decisions regarding your insurance eligibility or  premlums; or  o Use genetic information that is obtained from research when making a decision 10 hire, promote,  or fire an individual, or when setting the terms of employment.  Be aware that neither GINA nor the comparable Wisconsin State laws protect against genetic  discrimination by companies that sell life insurance, disability insurance, or long-term care insurance.  These laws also do not stop employers or health insurers from discriminating against someone on the  basis of a pre-existing or apparent genetic disease or disolder.  As part of this research, your genotype and phenotype data will be de-identified and shaled with the  National Institutes of Health (NIB) GWAS data repository. From this repository it will be available to  other researchers conducting research with NIH funds. The information that is shared will not include  dilect identifiers.

into the electronic medical records (pgx) why are you being asked to take part in this research study you have been asked to participate in this research because you are over the age of 50, you receive your healthca1v at marshfield clinic and you may someday be prescribed a medication of intetest to our lesearch pmject. there are 7 sites involved with the emerge research network, bttps;//www.me.vanderbilt.edu/victr,qcg/proiects/acc'index.php/m4in pakg, and the goal is to enroll about 750 people for this lesearch project at each site. why is this research study being done this research is being done to better understand how genetic information can affect medical care of patients. you are invited to take part in a lesearch study funded by the national human genome resealeh institute (nhgri), pharmacogenom ics research network (pgrn) and the marshfield clinic research foundation. the pumose of this research project is to establish a group of 750 people seen at marshfield cl inic who will contribute to a research effort to help us learn more about genetics and response to medications known as pharmacogenomics. pharmacogenomics is the study of how an individual's genetics (dna) affects the body's response to drugs. it is the hope that drugs might one day be chosen for individuals based on each person's genetic makeup. environment, diet, age, lifestyle, and state of health all can influence a person's response to medicines. however, understanding an individual's genetic makeup is thought to be key to prescribing drugs that work better and are safer for you. the future hope is for doctors to analyze a patient's genetic profile and prescribe the best available drug therapy. not only will this take the guesswork out of finding the right drug, it will speed recovery time and increase safety as the likelihood of adverse reactions is reduced. pharmacogenom ics has the potential to d17matically reduce the estimated 100,000 deaths and 2 million hospitalizations each year in the united states as the result of negative drug response. taking part in this study is voluntary. whether you decide to take part in this research is completely up to you. read the following information carefully before you make a decision. in writing this consent form, some technical words were necessary. please ask for an explanation of any you do not understand. ask the study doctor or staff as many questions as you wish about this consent form and what will happen to you as part of this research. irb approved october l, 2012 ****** result for image/page 2 ****** consent form br110412 page 2 of 7 what will happen if you agree to be in this research study if you aglee to be in this lesearch study, you will be asked to do the following: you will be asked to meet with a lesearch coordinator to discuss the project in depth. this will be in person at marshfield clinic. we will discuss the infolmed consent and explain why we are conducting this project, the risks, benefits, alternatives and responsibilities. we will answer all your questions about the project. if you choose to panicipate, we will require a signed iiipaa privacy form and an informed consent. you will be asked to complete a shon questionnaire. this questionnaire will help us understand how people look at and feel about genetics. this will also help researchers understand how genetics (your genes) influence the way specific drugs may work for you and for other people. a follow-up questionnaire may be sent to you in the future to complete. you will be asked for a blood sample. a trained marshfield clinic phlebotomist will draw 2 vials (2 tablespoons) of blood. the dna, or genetic part, will be taken from your blood and sent to a clinically certified (clia) laboratory at marshfield clinic or off-site for analysis. about 84 genes will be genotyped or looked at. these genes ale conside d high impact pharmacogenetic genes. this means variants or variations in these genes are either known or thought to be important in drug effectiveness, drug dosing or adverse outcomes. we will add certain information about your dna genetic results in your medical records. we will add this clinically important genetic information regarding these variants into your medical ivcords. we will work with your marshfield clinic physician with the goal of having your doctor use this information for medications if they are someday prescribed to you. this knowledge will be very beneficial to your doctor with regards to dosing, efficacy and potential adverse ptoblems. initially, this data will bc limited to 3 drugs: plavix (medication for heart stents), warfarin (blood thinner) and simvastatin (cholesterol lowering medication). as we improve knowledge and ability to link more genetic variants with other drugs, data will be expanded to include other drugs that may affect your healthcare and prescribing of these other medications. this information will include genetic variants recognized by the fda or other experts regarding specific drugs. we will store the rest of your genetic information in the research warehouse for future use. 'i-hese data may be used for additional pharmacogenetic research. periodically, when new fda warnings are discovered, we may update your medical record with information on how you may react to diffetent drugs. this study may find you have one or more genetic risk factors that we were not looking for. these conditions may be uutable, therefore you and your healthcare provider should know about them. an example of such a clinically relevant variant is a condition called malignant hypelthermia. this condition is more common in wisconsin, and can result in serious complications if cenain types of anesthesia are given prior to surgery. if one of these variants is noted to be present in your genetic make-up, we will inform you and your healthcare provider. this information will be placed in your medical record. clinical and scientific experts will help decide which genetic variants may requile clinical attention. if any such variants are found in your dna, you and your primary health care provider will be sent a letter informing you or these results. however, you and/or your insurance provider will be responsible for any costs associated with clinical follow-up related to this genetic information. it is important that you notify study staff and/or your primary care provider if your contact information changes. irb approved - october 11, 2012 ****** result for

information may be added to your medical record during this project. what are the possible risks or discomforts from being in this study blood draw risks: there is always a risk when having blood taken from a vein. this blood draw will not be any different than the blood draw for normal clinical labs. risks associated with blood draws include the potential for minor pain and slight bruising. there is a very small chance of infection at the site where the blood was drawn. some people may faint when their blood is drawn. genetic testing: risks of learning genetic test results may include emotional upset or insurance or job discrimination. confidentiality risk: clinically relevant genetic information will be put into your medical this information will be tteated the same as other medical information in your medical record. all records and materials that identify you will be ueated as confidential. remaining genetic information that will not currently be used outside of your medical records will be stored on a secure computer system. a limited number of approved researchers and staff have access to the database. few individuals will have access to the codes that link your identity to the data and all people working with your data are required to protect your privacy. although remote, there is a risk that information about your genetic make-up may be accidentally

2019-05-13,../data//ic_parent,../data//ic_parent.txt,"USIDNet DNA / Cell Repository Informed Consent (parent)    I hereby consent to the collection of ____ml (___tsp) blood or a tissue biopsy from my  child for submission to the USIDNet DNA and Cell Repository, a research resource  supported by the National Institutes of Health. The Repository col ects, stores, and  distributes cell cultures and DNA samples from people with all forms of primary  immunodeficiency disorder, from unaffected family members and from other healthy  people. The samples in the Repository wil be maintained by and at Coriell Cel  Repositories in Camden, NJ.    I understand that my child’s sample will be used to create cell lines that will be added to  the Repository’s collection. The purpose of this collection is to make specimens readily  available for use in research and teaching. Since the Primary Immunodeficiency (PI)  diseases are rare, donation of this sample to the Repository may give a broader group  of scientists access to rare research materials from patients and families affected with  Primary Immunodeficiency. It is hoped that wider scientific access and study may help  to improve understanding of these diseases and to develop new diagnostic tests and  new treatments for these and other disorders.    The Repository will take strong measures to protect my family’s privacy. All identifying  information will be removed from the blood or tissue specimen by our doctor before the  sample is submitted to the Repository. The specimen will be given a unique code  number for future identification and the record maintained by the Repository wil only  contain general information such as age, sex, state of residence, diagnosis and  molecular defect (if known). The USIDNet Repository wil not have my child’s name,  address or other specific identifying information to link the sample specifically to him/her  and therefore it is very unlikely that anyone would be able to determine in the future that  the sample was taken from my child.    Because the link to our name has been broken, the USIDNet Repository will probably  be unable to provide us with any information about scientific findings that may be  discovered by scientists working with the sample specifically or whether any results that  are published in the scientific literature are related to the sample that we submitted. I  understand that a potential link may remain between the sample and my child if the  USIDNet Repository keeps a record of the name and address of the physician who  submitted this sample. In this event the USIDNet Repository could contact our doctor  and potential y transmit back to us study results or a request for my child to participate  1    in additional studies – although the Repository would stil not have our identity in its  records and would not have enough information to contact us without the assistance of  my doctor. If my doctor is unavailable or is unable to contact us for some reason, I  understand that the Repository wil not be able to contact us nor provide any information  to us concerning my child’s sample.    I would ( ) would not ( ) like to have my doctor’s name remain linked to  my coded sample in the Repository’s records.    I would ( ) would not ( ) like to be contacted by my doctor in the future  about the results of research studies performed on my sample or with  possible opportunities for me to join additional research studies.    There will be no direct benefit or payment to my child for participating, but the sample  may benefit the community at large or some particular group. My child’s sample wil stay  in the Repository indefinitely and it will not be possible to request its removal from the  collection once all information identifying it as coming from my child has been removed.    The medical risks of providing these specimens are minimal. The risk for venipuncture  is minor transient pain and slight possibility of infection. The risk for skin biopsy is mild  local pain, slight bleeding, the possibility of a small scar, and slight possibility of  infection.    This donation is voluntary, and if I choose not to have my child participate there will be  no penalty or loss of entitled benefits.

Rather they are separate bony plates connected by soft tissue. As children  mature and their brain volume reaches adult size these bony plates fuse and form the adult skull.  In some instances a child may be born with some of these bone plates fused earlier than normal.  This phenomena is called cranio(head)synostosis(abnormal development of a joint).  The connections that separate each individual skull bones are called sutures. The early closing of  a suture can lead to an abnormally shaped head and pressure inside of the skull. Craniosynostosis  is a phenomenon that may be isolated (no other symptoms) or may be part of a syndrome (other  body systems are involved). Craniosynostosis can occur in only one family member or can run in  families and several family members may be affected. Either way it is likely that a change or a  combination of several changes in our genetic code may have caused craniosynostosis to occur.       WHY IS THIS RESEARCH?    This research project is being done to identify and study the genes associated with these very  specific face and skull abnormalities.  We would like to determine how variations in our genes  relate to the development of craniosynostosis. No other genetic testing will be done without your  specific approval. Because face and skull abnormalities have associated medical problems, this  study may help us find better methods of diagnosis, treatment and/or prevention of this birth  problem.    Participation in this study may require approximately 2 hours of your time.    SUBJECTS:    Families with at least one child with the presence of a confirmed finding of a skull and/or face  abnormality found at birth or craniosynostosis by a clinical geneticist, radiologist, and surgeon  will be asked to participate in the study.     The expected enrollment at UCI is approximately 100 patients and their parents over a 3-year  period. This study is part of a larger research study performed at the University of California at  Davis and is hoping to have a total of 750 participants.     The majority of craniosynostosis patients are diagnosed in the first year of life, and therefore,  most research participants are expected to be younger than 12 months of age. You can, however,  participate at any age.      Approved by IRB on: 04/24/2009 HS# 2007-5631 Void After: 04/23/2010      IRB USE ONLY - DO NOT ALTER THIS FOOTER        e-CPA# 4917       2 of 13  Study participants will be identified through the pediatric, genetics and craniofacial clinics and  support organizations throughout Orange County. Where possible other local hospitals and  physicians will be made aware of this research study at UC Irvine, and they might also refer  potential participants.    Children over the age of 7 years, who are able to understand the risks and benefits of the study,  will be asked to provide their written assent (a simplified version of the form you are signing). If  your child is willing to participate in the study, your written consent and your child’s assent will  be obtained by the Principal Investigator, Dr. Virginia Kimonis, at the UCI General Clinical  Research Center or the UCI Medical Center.      PROCEDURES:    Below, we have listed the procedures we would like for you to participate in today. We will  explain the procedures in detail to you including who will perform the procedure, the risks and or  discomforts involved and the time it takes to perform the procedure. By initialing and checking  off on a procedure you are indicating that you understand the procedure and that you are  agreeing for the procedure to be performed:     Check /Initials    ____    ____   Chart review:  Data will be analyzed from your medical records.     We may ask to obtain relevant medical records from you or your physician(s).  You will be asked to sign a medical record release form so that we may review  medical records that are important to our research. Whenever possible, a review  of medical records will be completed prior to the study visit to limit the length of  the visit. A medical release form and a UCI HIPAA form for research studies will  therefore be mailed to you before your appointment. Once we receive the signed  forms back from you we can start to obtain medical records.    ____    ____    We will also ask you to complete a medical and family history. This will include  questions about your medical history involving medical conditions, surgeries,  development milestones and current and past medication. We will also ask you  questions about yourself, family history, other children, siblings, grandparents and  possibly other family members and ask for a history of other birth defects. These  questions may include age, ethnic background, pregnancy history, and exposure  to drugs, alcohol, and smoking.  Identifying information like names will only be  collected on consented individuals. The information obtained will be entered and  kept in a password protected database at UCI and paper files will be kept in  locked file cabinets.

This could be frozen blood, cells from your blood or  your skin which can be grown in the laboratory and multiplied or tissue which  was generated either from a biopsy or another surgical procedure (ie bone  shavings from the surgical opening of a suture) By initialing this line you are  allowing us to transfer such a sample from your provider for analysis.    ____    ____    Digital photographs: We will take digital photographs of you. You might be  identifiable in some of these clinical photographs. We will ask you to sign a  separate Photograph Release form for all photography. The digital photographs  will be entered and stored digitally on a secure server maintained at UCI. To  decline photography will not exclude you from the study.    ____    ____  Physical Examination (Takes 20-25 mins): We will perform a detailed physical  exam that will include ophthalmologic and neurological assessments as part of  routine physical examination. This examination will include measurement of  height, weight, head-circumference etc. Pulse rate and body temperature will also  be measured.    In addition we will take measurements of your skull and face including head  circumference, arm span, upper and lower body segments. The measurements of  the head and face will be made with a sliding caliper. The eyes will also be  examined. Abnormalities of the trunk will be assessed and extremities will be  measured. This will either be performed at the UCI Medical Center or at one of  the UCI General Clinical Research Centers (GCRC) by study physicians and  study nurses. If during the physical exam additional clinical care is necessary, the  appropriate referrals will be made. The result of this examination will be recorded  in the specifically designed physical examination form and the data will be  deposited into a password protected database file.    ____ ____ Blood Pressure: Painless application of blood pressure cuff.    ____    ____    Collection of a Venous Blood Sample (Takes about 5-15 mins): A sample of your  blood will be collected, one time only, by inserting a needle into a vein in your  arm. If you are an adult, you will give up to 6 teaspoon (3 10 ml tubes, 30 cc).  If  you are minor you will give an amount of blood proportional to your age.  If you  are between 16 and 17 years of age, you will give up to 6 teaspoons (3 10 ml  tubes, 30 cc); 10-15 years, up to 3 teaspoons (3 5 ml tubes, 15 cc); 5-10 years, up  to 2 teaspoons (2 5 ml tubes, 10 cc); and if you are less than 5 years, you will give  up to 1 teaspoon (1 5 ml tube, 5 cc).  Your blood will be taken at phlebotomy  center such as at the UCI Gottschalk Medical Plaza or the UCI GCRC by  qualified personnel.      Approved by IRB on: 04/24/2009 HS# 2007-5631 Void After: 04/23/2010      IRB USE ONLY - DO NOT ALTER THIS FOOTER        e-CPA# 4917       4 of 13                          In the event that you may have a blood test scheduled through your private  physician in the near future and if you would like to avoid giving blood at the  study visit, you may combine this blood draw with one scheduled in the future.  Please let us know and we may be able to accommodate your request.    A portion of your blood will be sent to perform DNA and other molecular tests  for craniosynostosis in the laboratory of Dr. Simeon Boyd at UC Davis. The  remaining blood will be retained by Dr. Kimonis’ laboratory at UC Irvine and  stored as DNA for future research and possible establishment of cell lines either  locally or at a National Cell Repository.     The establishment of cell lines from blood or tissue samples is to help reproduce  and make the cultured cells last a long time. This helps research continue without  having to keep asking for more samples. White blood cells can be cultured from  blood samples.    ____   ____    Collection of a buccal swab or saliva sample (Takes less than 5 mins):  When a  blood sample is not available or you would like to avoid having blood collected  from you we can collect a cheek (buccal) swab sample or a saliva sample instead.  A specialist will wipe the inside of your cheek with a cotton swab to collect cells  or will ask you to spit into a cup. These samples will be used for DNA testing     ____    ____    You agree that your biological sample may be shared with other researchers in the  future. None of your personally identifying information will be released for any  other research study in the future    Taking part in this study is voluntary. You may choose not to participate or if you do join the  study and change your mind later, you may stop participating in the study at any time without  fear or penalty or loss of benefits or change in the present or future care, of which you are  entitled.       RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS:    Risk to the subjects from any of the study procedures will be minimal. The clinical and blood  evaluations will use the same techniques as those routinely carried out in clinical practice.     Blood Drawing:  Minimal risks associated with a blood draw are minor discomfort, bruising,  dizziness or rarely fainting or infection. When possible we will draw blood at the time of a  clinically indicated procedure so that you may not need to have blood drawn only for research  purposes. The blood collection will be done using standard infection control procedures and in  compliance with good clinical practice.

Transfer of previously collected sample by your physician (cell lines, bone shavings, blood etc) :   No risk     Physical Examination:  You may feel slightly inconvenienced as the doctor measures your face,  but this should not cause any discomfort.     Digital photographs: Minimal risk which includes psychological discomfort. Some individuals  might not feel comfortable to have their picture taken. Because you might be identifiable in some  of these photographs, there is a possible risk of breach of confidentiality, although all efforts will  be made to minimize this.     Breach of Confidentiality: Because personal information about you will be collected, there is the  potential risk of breach of confidentiality, although all efforts will be made to minimize this. The  results of the tests performed for research purposes will NOT be placed in your medical records.   A copy of this consent form will NOT be placed in your medical record.    If you choose to be informed of any genetic findings from this study that may be of significance  to you, you will need to contact your physician as to whether these results should be included in  your medical chart. This means that if information is released to your physician with your  permission, laboratory results may be included in your medical record.    Genetic Research: There is the risk that we may find that you or a member of your family may  have a gene that can cause a congenital abnormality. Some people involved in genetic studies  feel anxious about the possibility of carrying an altered gene that places them at risk or that may  be passed on to children. If these feelings arise at any time during the study, you may contact us  and we will arrange for you to speak with a genetic counselor. There is also a risk that you or a  member of your family may have such a gene and we do not detect it in this study.     You should be aware that because we are testing family members we may detect instances of  non-paternity or adoption. If you wish, you may let us know in confidence if this is a possibility,  since it may otherwise interfere with our analysis. In all cases, this information will be kept in  the strictest confidence and will not be divulged to anyone including you.     You should also be aware that there might be social and economic disadvantages, which can be  associated with the gathering of genetic information. You should understand that our testing  might find an inherited defective gene, which puts you or a relative at risk for a genetic disorder  in the future. Genetic information divulged to the wrong source, could affect you and your  family if an insurance company or employer acquired this genetic information. We will do our  best to keep all information confidential and only with your permission would we make this  information available to others.

However, there are situations  where we may suspect that you have a known genetic syndrome. In such cases, an earlier  diagnosis may prevent or alleviate long-term medical complications. In addition, evaluation of  other family members may identify individuals at risk for having a child with craniosynostosis  syndrome. If the study team obtains information that they think might be significant to your  family, we will have the results confirmed by a second certified clinical laboratory.    Most laboratories will ask for fresh blood samples in order to ensure accuracy of the results. If  important, abnormal results are confirmed, they will be reported to the Principal Investigator and  made available to you by Dr. Simeon Boyd or Dr Virginia Kimonis or a physician of your choice  at no cost to you or your insurer. Genetic counseling will be provided and names of outside  resources will be given to you.  And since this study may involve patients and his/her parents,  information will only be shared with the individual him/herself and parents, unless the family  requests otherwise. This information will not be shared with any other family member other than  the individual him/herself and parents, unless the family signs a release of medical records.  Parents will be given the option not to receive the information about themselves.      You should also be aware that it is possible that we may not detect changes in DNA that might  cause craniosynostosis, even if present. Therefore, you should not assume that these changes are  absent or that you are not at risk for having another child with craniosynostosis, if we do not  notify you of any abnormalities.

However, we hope that the information  obtained may help us in the development of accurate and efficient diagnostic testing and better  treatment strategies of people with these conditions.     Benefits for society are potentially great if the scientific and health communities gain  information about the syndrome genes, their function as they relate to normal craniofacial  development and the pathogenesis of these conditions.

due to the fact that a child s brain needs room to grow, the bones which make up our skull are not fused at birth. rather they are separate bony plates connected by soft tissue. as children mature and their brain volume reaches adult size these bony plates fuse and form the adult skull. in some instances a child may be born with some of these bone plates fused earlier than normal. this phenomena is called cranio(head)synostosis(abnormal development of a joint). the connections that separate each individual skull bones are called sutures. the early closing of a suture can lead to an abnormally shaped head and pressure inside of the skull. craniosynostosis is a phenomenon that may be isolated (no other symptoms) or may be part of a syndrome (other body systems are involved). craniosynostosis can occur in only one family member or can run in families and several family members may be affected. either way it is likely that a change or a combination of several changes in our genetic code may have caused craniosynostosis to occur. why is this research this research project is being done to identify and study the genes associated with these very specific face and skull abnormalities. we would like to determine how variations in our genes relate to the development of craniosynostosis. no other genetic testing will be done without your specific approval. because face and skull abnormalities have associated medical problems, this study may help us find better methods of diagnosis, treatment and/or prevention of this birth problem. participation in this study may require approximately 2 hours of your time. subjects: families with at least one child with the presence of a confirmed finding of a skull and/or face abnormality found at birth or craniosynostosis by a clinical geneticist, radiologist, and surgeon will be asked to participate in the study. the expected enrollment at uci is approximately 100 patients and their parents over a 3-year period. this study is part of a larger research study performed at the university of california at davis and is hoping to have a total of 750 participants. the majority of craniosynostosis patients are diagnosed in the first year of life, and therefore, most research participants are expected to be younger than 12 months of age. you can, however, participate at any age. approved by irb on: 04/24/2009 hs# 2007-5631

organizations throughout orange county. where possible other local hospitals and physicians will be made aware of this research study at uc irvine, and they might also refer potential participants. children over the age of 7 years, who are able to understand the risks and benefits of the study, will be asked to provide their written assent (a simplified version of the form you are signing). if your child is willing to participate in the study, your written consent and your child s assent will be obtained by the principal investigator, dr. virginia kimonis, at the uci general clinical research center or the uci medical center. procedures: below, we have listed the procedures we would like for you to participate in today. we will explain the procedures in detail to you including who will perform the procedure, the risks and or discomforts involved and the time it takes to perform the procedure. by initialing and checking off on a procedure you are indicating that you understand the procedure and that you are agreeing for the procedure to be performed: check /initials   chart review: data will be analyzed from your medical records. we may ask to obtain relevant medical records from you or your physician(s). you will be asked to sign a medical record release form so that we may review medical records that are important to our research. whenever possible, a review of medical records will be completed prior to the study visit to limit the length of the visit. a medical release form and a uci hipaa form for research studies will therefore be mailed to you before your appointment. once we receive the signed forms back from you we can start to obtain medical records.   we will also ask you to complete a medical and family history. this will include questions about your medical history involving medical conditions, surgeries, development milestones and current and past medication. we will also ask you questions about yourself, family history, other children, siblings, grandparents and possibly other family members and ask for a history of other birth defects. these questions may include age, ethnic background, pregnancy history, and exposure to drugs, alcohol, and smoking. identifying information like names will only be collected on consented individuals. the information obtained will be entered and kept in a password protected database at

previously collected sample (i.e. blood, cell line, dna, biopsy tissue etc.) sometimes your medical provider may have stored previously collected biological samples from you. this could be frozen blood, cells from your blood or your skin which can be grown in the laboratory and multiplied or tissue which was generated either from a biopsy or another surgical procedure (ie bone shavings from the surgical opening of a suture) by initialing this line you are allowing us to transfer such a sample from your provider for analysis.   digital photographs: we will take digital photographs of you. you might be identifiable in some of these clinical photographs. we will ask you to sign a separate photograph release form for all photography. the digital photographs will be entered and stored digitally on a secure server maintained at uci. to decline photography will not exclude you from the study.   physical examination (takes 20-25 mins): we will perform a detailed physical exam that will include ophthalmologic and neurological assessments as part of routine physical examination. this examination will include measurement of height, weight, head-circumference etc. pulse rate and body temperature will also be measured. in addition we will take measurements of your skull and face including head circumference, arm span, upper and lower body segments. the measurements of the head and face will be made with a sliding caliper. the eyes will also be examined. abnormalities of the trunk will be assessed and extremities will be measured. this will either be performed at the uci medical center or at one of the uci general clinical research centers (gcrc) by study physicians and study nurses. if during the physical exam additional clinical care is necessary, the appropriate referrals will be made. the result of this examination will be recorded in the specifically designed physical examination form and the data will be deposited into a password protected database file.   blood pressure: painless application of blood pressure cuff.   collection of a venous blood sample (takes about 5-15 mins): a sample of your blood will be collected, one time only, by inserting a needle into a vein in your arm. if you are an adult, you will give up to 6 teaspoon (3 10 ml tubes, 30 cc). if you are minor you will give an amount of blood proportional to your age. if you are between 16 and 17 years of age, you will give up to 6 teaspoons (3 10 ml tubes, 30 cc); 10-15 years, up to 3 teaspoons (3 5 ml tubes, 15 cc); 5-10 years, up to 2 teaspoons (2 5 ml tubes, 10 cc); and if you are less than 5 years, you will give up to 1 teaspoon (1 5 ml tube, 5 cc). your blood will be taken at phlebotomy center such as at the uci gottschalk medical plaza or the uci gcrc by qualified

your private physician in the near future and if you would like to avoid giving blood at the study visit, you may combine this blood draw with one scheduled in the future. please let us know and we may be able to accommodate your request. a portion of your blood will be sent to perform dna and other molecular tests for craniosynostosis in the laboratory of dr. simeon boyd at uc davis. the remaining blood will be retained by dr. kimonis laboratory at uc irvine and stored as dna for future research and possible establishment of cell lines either locally or at a national cell repository. the establishment of cell lines from blood or tissue samples is to help reproduce and make the cultured cells last a long time. this helps research continue without having to keep asking for more samples. white blood cells can be cultured from blood samples.   collection of a buccal swab or saliva sample (takes less than 5 mins): when a blood sample is not available or you would like to avoid having blood collected from you we can collect a cheek (buccal) swab sample or a saliva sample instead. a specialist will wipe the inside of your cheek with a cotton swab to collect cells or will ask you to spit into a cup. these samples will be used for dna testing   you agree that your biological sample may be shared with other researchers in the future. none of your personally identifying information will be released for any other research study in the future taking part in this study is voluntary. you may choose not to participate or if you do join the study and change your mind later, you may stop participating in the study at any time without fear or penalty or loss of benefits or change in the present or future care, of which you are entitled. risks and discomforts: risk to the subjects from any of the study procedures will be minimal. the clinical and blood evaluations will use the same techniques as those routinely carried out in clinical practice. blood drawing: minimal risks associated with a blood draw are minor discomfort, bruising, dizziness or rarely fainting or infection. when possible we will draw blood at the time of a clinically indicated procedure so that you may not need to have blood drawn only for research purposes. the blood collection will be done using standard infection control procedures and in compliance with good clinical practice.

Much  of this research is done using human tissue samples, such as blood. Through these studies,  researchers hope to find new ways to detect, treat, and maybe prevent or cure health problems.  Some of these studies may be about how genes affect health, or how genes affect response to  treatment. Some of them may lead to new products, such as drugs or tests for diseases.  A “biobank” is a collection of stored samples and information. We are asking you to let us store  some of your blood and health information in the Duke Biobank. This is because you have been  a patient of the Duke University Health System.  You can take part in this storage project or not. This consent form gives information to help you  decide. Please read it carefully and take all the time you need to make your choice. Be sure to  ask us as many questions as you want.  Everyone who takes part in research should know that:   Taking part may involve some risks.   Taking part is voluntary. If you choose to take part, you can quit at any time.   No matter what you decide, now or in the future, it will not affect your medical care.  WHY IS THIS PROJECT BEING DONE? The purpose of the Biobank is to collect and store  blood and health information so researchers can use them in future studies.  WHAT IS INVOLVED? If you agree to take part, we will ask you to sign this form. We will give  you a signed copy to keep. Here is what will happen next:  1. We will get a blood sample from you. We will use a needle to draw about 3 tablespoons of  blood from your arm.  2. We will get some information about you and your health.   We will ask you for some basic information, such as your name, age, race, and family  health history. We will contact you no more than once a year to update this information.   We will get some information from your medical record. Examples include test results,  medical procedures, images (such as X-rays), and medicines you take. We will use your  medical record from time to time to update this information.   We will get research data from any studies done using your sample and information.  3. We will store your sample and information in the Biobank, along with those from all the other  people who take part. There is no limit on the length of time we will keep them. We may go  on using them for research unless you decide to stop taking part in the Biobank.  4. We will let researchers use the materials stored in the Biobank for approved studies.  Researchers from Duke, other universities, the government, and drug- or health-related  companies can apply to use the materials. A science committee at the Biobank will review  each request. There will also be an ethics review.  We will not give researchers your name or other information that could directly identify you.  1  5. We may contact you about additional research. We will not notify you every time your  sample and information are used in a study. However, the Biobank may contact you with  offers to take part in other research. There will be a new consent form just for these other  studies, so you can decide then to take part or not.  We will contact you about no more than two other studies per year.  6. Some of your genetic and health information may be put into scientific databases outside  the Biobank, along with that from many other people. Information that could directly identify  you will never be included. However, because your genetic information is unique to you,  there is a chance that someone could trace it back to you. We believe the chance this will  happen is very small. But the risk may grow in the future if people come up with new ways of  tracing information.  WHAT ARE THE POSSIBLE RISKS? The most common risks of drawing blood are brief pain  and bruising.  There is a risk that someone could get access to the data we have stored about you. In some  cases, it could be misused. We believe the chance this will happen is very small, but we cannot  make guarantees.  WILL MY INFORMATION BE KEPT PRIVATE? Your privacy is very important to us and we will  make every effort to protect it. Here are just a few of the steps we will take:   We will remove your name and other identifiers from your sample and information. We  will replace them with a code number. There will be a master list linking the code  numbers to names, but we will keep it separate from the samples and information.   Researchers who study your sample and information will not know who you are. They  must also promise that they will not try to find out who you are.   We will not give information that identifies you to anyone, except if required by law.  Information that is shared outside Duke may no longer be protected by the federal  privacy law called ‘HIPAA’. But it will be protected as described in this form and may be  covered by other privacy laws.  There is a federal law called GINA that makes it illegal for employers and health insurers to  discriminate against you based on your genetic information. GINA will not protect you from  discrimination if you apply for other kinds of insurance, such as life or disability insurance.  We also got a Certificate of Confidentiality from the federal government. This will help us fight  any legal demand (such as a court order) to give out information that could identify you.  ARE THERE ANY BENEFITS? You will not get direct benefit. The main reason you may want  to take part is to help researchers make discoveries that might help people in the future.  ARE THERE ANY COSTS OR PAYMENTS? There are no costs to you or your insurance. We  will give you a $25 gift card to thank you for your time.  If any of the research leads to new tests, drugs, or other commercial products, you will not get  any profits.  WILL I FIND OUT THE RESULTS OF THE RESEARCH? You should not expect to get  individual results from research done using your sample. Research is not the same as medical  care.  2  If we discover something that is very important to your health right now, we will try but cannot  promise to contact you. You can get general news about the kinds of studies being done  through the Biobank at www.dukebiobank.edu.  WHAT ARE MY OPTIONS? Taking part in the Biobank is your choice. You can choose to take  part or not take part.  WHAT IF I CHANGE MY MIND? You can leave the project at any time. Just call 919-666-3434  and let us know.  Please note that if we have already given out some of your sample and information for  researchers to study, we cannot get them back. But we will send you a form so you can tell us  what to do with any of your materials that are left in the Biobank.  WHAT IF I HAVE QUESTIONS? For questions or more information about this project, contact  Dr. Erica Lee, the Biobank Director, at 919-555-1212.

PURPOSE:  You are being asked to volunteer for a research study. This research is sponsored by  the Medical University of South Carolina’s (MUSC) SCOR (Specialized Center of  research) on sex and gender factors affecting women’s health.  The purpose of this  study is to understand how obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) affects memory  and other aspects of brain function in early postmenopausal women. OSAS is a sleep  disorder in which patients have abnormal pauses in their breathing during sleep which  can be associated with a decrease in blood oxygen levels. OSAS has several adverse  effects on health including heart disease, stroke, fatigue and excessive daytime  sleepiness. You are being asked to participate in this study because you are a  postmenopausal woman between 45-60 years of age, within 5 years of having achieved  natural menopause and either have OSAS or have a high likelihood of having OSAS.   Your participation in this project will help to see how well functional Magnetic  Resonance Imaging (fMRI) can measure your brain’s activity as you perform memory  and attention tasks while in the scanner. It is hoped that the data collected in this study  will lead to future fMRI studies to better understand the impact of obstructive sleep  apnea on the brain. Another purpose of this study is to collect blood samples (plasma,  DNA and RNA) for future research to learn more about preventing, diagnosing, and  treating diseases.   The investigators in charge of this study are Dr. Chitra Lal and Dr. Jane Joseph. There  may be other people on the research team assisting at different times during the study.  The fMRI scanning is being done at the Center for Biomedical Imaging (CBI) on 30 Bee  Street on the Medical University of South Carolina campus and will involve  approximately 10 volunteers.  B.  PROCEDURES:  If you agree to be in this study, the following will happen:  1. You will go to CBI on 30 Bee Street at a time that you have scheduled with one  of the research team members. After you provide your consent, you will undergo  the following procedures that take about 30 minutes:    a. You will be tested for normal visual function using tests that an eye doctor  would perform.     b. You will fill out a questionnaire about what hand you prefer to use for different  everyday tasks and will complete standard vocabulary tests.        IRB Number: Pro00025410 Date Approved 6/16/2015  Expiration Date: 6/15/2016  Page 2 of 11        Version 05/07/2013    c. You will fill out a questionnaire asking whether you have any metal in your  body as well as any other medical conditions that may need to be considered  for you to enter the fMRI scanner, which will be used to take pictures of your  brain.  The metal screening questionnaire will be reviewed by the individual  operating the MRI scanner and if any risks are identified, you may not be able  to participate.     d. You will be asked to provide a urine sample to screen for pregnancy before  going into the fMRI scanner.  If the results are positive, you will not be able to  participate.       2. After the screening session, you will sit in front of a computer in a quiet room at  CBI to practice the tasks that you will be asked to perform while in the fMRI  scanner. You will perform some brief tests of attention and memory for about 5  minutes. You will practice two attention tasks for about 5 minutes and practice  two memory tasks for about 3 minutes. These tests record how accurately and  quickly you respond to visual stimuli and make simple choices and decisions. .    3. After the practice session, you will be asked to perform simple visual and  memory tasks outside of the fMRI scanner. This will last about 30 minutes.    	    4. You will be taken to the fMRI scanner by the research team member. In the  interest of your individual safety, the safety of others, and to prevent damage to  the equipment itself, you will be asked to remove all jewelry, body piercings, hair  accessories, belts, wallets, credit cards, and loose change and leave these items  with the experimenter. You will then be instructed about specific fMRI  procedures, which include the need to remain still while in the scanner, the need  to remain attentive and awake during the study and how we will communicate  with you while you are in the fMRI scanner. You will then lie down on your back  on a narrow bed, which will then be placed in a tunnel that is 6 feet by 22 inches  wide and open at each end. The experimenter will take a few minutes to make  sure you are positioned correctly, have on ear protection and are comfortable.  After you are in the scanner, the experimenter will go  to the control room and  communicate with you through an intercom system. The experimenter will be  able to see you at all times and will check with you through the intercom to make  sure you are ok. This will last about 5-10 minutes.    5. Once the fMRI scanner starts, you will look at pictures or letters on a screen that  you view through a mirror while you are laying down. Just like you practiced  earlier, you will respond to the pictures by pressing buttons. You will try to lay as  still as you can and try not to talk unless asked to do so by the experimenter. You  will hear loud noises from the scanner. fMRI scanning will take 45 minutes to an     IRB Number: Pro00025410 Date Approved 6/16/2015  Expiration Date: 6/15/2016  Page 3 of 11        Version 05/07/2013    hour to complete.  Once fMRI scanning is complete, you will be taken out of the  scanner.    6. A blood sample will be drawn from you by inserting a needle in your arm as part  of the study on the second floor of the Clinical Sciences building of MUSC. Study  personnel will take you from CBI to the Clinical Sciences building for this  purpose. For this study, a maximum of three tubes of blood (30 mL or 2  tablespoons) will be drawn. This process will take approximately 30 minutes    The sample (plasma, DNA, RNA) will be stored in the MUSC Biomedical Bank for  future research to learn about, prevent, treat, and cure any type of health  problem.  It will be used to gather information about you and your disease and  genetic information (DNA, RNA) may be obtained from the material.  Information  and results about your sample will not be added to your medical records. The  blood will be biobanked for future research and will not be analyzed as part of  this study.    You have the option to not participate in the banking of blood portion of the study.  Do you wish to provide your blood sample for this study?    ________Yes   ________No    Please read each sentence below and think about your choice. After reading  each sentence, initial by ""Yes"" or ""No.""    1. My sample may be used for genetic future research to learn about, prevent,  treat, or cure disease.

You are  also free to withdraw from the study at any time.   If you choose to withdraw from  the study, the blood sample that has been collected and not yet used in research  will be removed from the biobank and at that time will be destroyed.  No  additional samples will be collected. We ask that you contact Dr. Lal in writing to  let her know you are withdrawing your permission for your blood samples to be  used for future research. Her mailing address is:    Chitra Lal, MD, D-ABSM, FCCP, FAASM, FACP  Assistant Professor of Medicine  Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy and Sleep medicine, MUSC  96 Jonathan Lucas Street,  CSB Suite 812, MSC 630,  Charleston, SC 29425             Tel : (843)792-7776    C. DURATION:   You will complete one visit that will last about two hours. Your blood sample will be  collected as a one-time blood draw for future research use and stored in the MUSC  Biomedical Bank for up to one year after the study termination. After one year the  sample will be stored in the Pulmonary Division on the 8th floor of the Clinical Sciences  Building at MUSC for an unknown period of time, or until the sample is all gone.      D.  POSSIBLE DISCOMFORTS OR RISKS:  1. fMRI: Because the fMRI machine acts like a large magnet, it could move iron- containing objects in the MRI room during your examination, which could in the  process possibly harm you. Precautions have been taken to prevent such an  event from happening; loose metal objects, like pocket knives or key chains, are  not allowed in the MRI room. If you have a piece of metal in your body (excluding  dental fillings or some types of permanent retainers), such as a fragment in your  eye, some types of tattoos, permanent makeup, shrapnel, or fragments from  welding, aneurysm clips, ear implants, spinal nerve stimulators, or a pacemaker,  you will not be allowed into the MRI room and cannot have a MRI.        IRB Number: Pro00025410 Date Approved 6/16/2015  Expiration Date: 6/15/2016  Page 5 of 11        Version 05/07/2013    Having a MRI may mean some added discomfort to you. You may be bothered  by feelings of claustrophobia. If you do not like enclosed spaces, you should not  participate in this study. You may feel dizzy or nauseous if you move too quickly  going into or coming out of the scanner. The scanner bed moves slowly to  prevent this. The loud banging noise of the MRI scanner may bother you.  Temporary hearing loss has been reported from the loud noise. This is why you  will be asked to wear ear protection. You may experience dry or irritated eyes or  discomfort from lying on your back for an extended period. Let the experimenter  know if you need more cushions or support that will make you feel more  comfortable. You may also experience boredom or sleepiness while in the MRI  scanner.    2. Incidental Findings: Brain images collected for research purposes as part of the  study could reveal some type of brain abnormality or pathology. This occurs very  rarely but could be serious. This study collects pictures of the brain for research  purposes only and not for medical diagnosis. However, in the process of  collecting brain images for research purposes, the experimenters may notice an  abnormality. In this case, they will contact you and describe their observations  and, if the CD was not initially requested, we will give the images of your brain to  you directly.  You may share these with your primary care physician, if you so  choose.      3. Pregnancy: The risk of exposing an unborn child to a strong magnetic field is not  known. Therefore, if you are pregnant, or suspect that you might be pregnant,  you cannot participate in this study. Prior to your participation in this study, you  will take a urine pregnancy test.     4. Breach of confidentiality: The researchers realize that there are also non- physical risks associated with taking part in this study such as the accidental  disclosure of research data, which could result in such things as discrimination by  employers or insurance providers.  The chance that research data would be  released is very small and every attempt will be made to protect your confidential  participation in this study.  Any information collected and results of behavioral,  and MRI tests are coded with numbers and/or initials.  Your name, phone  number, address (or any other information uniquely identifying you) will not be  written on or associated with the information collected.  The investigator and staff  are the only people who know your personal information (name, phone number  and address).	   	   Information resulting from the research will not be entered into  your medical records.    Your health and genetic information obtained from your blood (plasma, DNA,  RNA) sample will also be handled in a way that is sensitive to your confidential  information. Your name and any other information that directly identifies you will  be removed from any specimen containers. The information about your identity     IRB Number: Pro00025410 Date Approved 6/16/2015  Expiration Date: 6/15/2016  Page 6 of 11        Version 05/07/2013    will be replaced with a coded number. A list that links the coded number to your  name, medical record number and date the sample was collected will be kept in  a locked, secure location.  This information will only be known to people who are  a part of this project, the biobank staff or to future researchers if approved for use  by a review board that protects people in research. Your material will be stored  with this coded number so that it can be used to document that the sample came  from you and can be used to link the samples to you and to your medical record  information.    5. Blood draw: Risks associated with drawing blood from your arm include  momentary discomfort and/or bruising. Infection, excess bleeding, clotting or  fainting are also possible, although unlikely.     6. Other risks: In addition to the risks listed above, you may experience a  previously unknown risk or side effect.    7. Genetic Research:  Research to identify genes that cause or contribute to a  disease or trait is an increasingly important way to try to understand the role of  genes in human disease. You have been given this consent form because the  Medical University of South Carolina investigators want to include your blood  sample (plasma, DNA, RNA) in a research project, or because they want to save  such biological samples for future research. There are several things you should  know before allowing your blood to be studied or to be stored.     1. Your blood sample (plasma, DNA, RNA) will be stored under your name or  some other type of identifier, which could be linked to you. Sometimes these  samples are shared for research purposes with other investigators at other  research sites. If this is done, the other investigators would not know your  name.     2. In addition to your name, other information about you might be connected to  your blood (plasma, DNA, RNA) sample. For instance, information about  race, ethnicity, sex, your medical history, and so forth might be available to  investigators studying your blood (plasma, DNA, RNA). Such information is  important for scientific reasons and sometimes for public health. It is possible  that genetic information will come to be associated with your racial or ethnic  group.    3. Genetic information about you will often apply (in one degree or another) to  family members. It is not generally the University’s policy to provide genetic  information about you to your family members. However, certain studies,  called ""pedigree studies"", share such information among family members. For  this and related research you will be asked if you are willing to share your  genetic information with your family members.     IRB Number: Pro00025410 Date Approved 6/16/2015  Expiration Date: 6/15/2016  Page 7 of 11        Version 05/07/2013      4. You have the right to refuse to allow your blood sample to be studied or  saved for future research studies. You may withdraw from this study at any  time and remove any samples that contain identifiers from research use after  the date of your withdrawal. This means that while the University might retain  the identified samples, the law often requires that the samples would not be  used for research.    5. South Carolina law mandates that your genetic information obtained from any  tests or from this research, be kept confidential. Our state law prohibits any  insurer using this information in a discriminatory manner against you or any of  your family in issuing or renewing insurance coverage for you or your family.  Our state law further prohibits our sharing your genetic information with  anyone except in a few narrow circumstances, one of these being a research  project of this type, approved by the Institutional Review Board and then we  must take all steps to protect your identity. You will still be responsible for  paying for health care, however. The Medical University of South Carolina will  not be responsible for such costs, even if care is needed for a condition  revealed during research or clinical testing.    6. Genetic research raises difficult questions about informing you and other  subjects of any results, or of future results. Some people feel anxious about  the possibility of having a defective gene that would place them or their  children at risk. Some people want to know what is found out about them;  others do not. The risks of knowing include anxiety and other psychological  distress. The risks of not knowing what is found include not being aware if  there is treatment for the problem being studied. However, these risks can  change depending on whether there is a treatment or cure for a particular  disease, and on how clear the results are. If there is a medical reason to seek  specific information from you, your doctor will tell you this. A process called  ""genetic counseling"" is often appropriate in such cases; you should ask your  doctor or nurse about this if you have any questions. In this study,  investigators will not tell you what they find out about you, nor will they  contact you if a test becomes available to diagnose a condition you might  have or later develop.  Future investigators may try to re-contact you later to find out about your  health.  If you are re-contacted and want to know what these future  investigators have learned about your samples, you should understand that  the following are the kinds of things the investigators or your health team  might tell you:  a) Information is too unclear to give you particular details, but you will receive  a newsletter informing you about the results of the project.     IRB Number: Pro00025410 Date Approved 6/16/2015  Expiration Date: 6/15/2016  Page 8 of 11        Version 05/07/2013    b) You carry a gene for a particular disease that can be treated.  c) You can carry a gene for a particular disease for which there is no current  treatment. This news might cause severe anxiety or other psychological  distress, depending on the severity of the disease.  d) You carry a gene for a disease and might consider informing relatives that  they, too, might carry the gene. It can be very difficult to decide whether to  share such information with relatives. Genetic counselors can help sort out  the various options in such a case.  In addition, for any future research, the investigator may contact you with  a new consent form giving you additional information.  7. If you are concerned about a potential genetic disorder, you and your doctor  might choose to test specifically for it. This would require additional blood or  tissue samples and would not be part of this research project. You should  discuss this option with your doctor or genetic counselor.    8. The presence of a genetic marker does not necessarily mean that an  individual will develop a disease. Informing people of all such markers  independently of medical need can cause unnecessary anxiety. On the other  hand, the absence of a marker does not mean that someone will not get the  disease. Genetic diseases appear because of a complex mixture of  hereditary, environmental, behavioral and other factors.    These are the best-known risks and challenges of genetic research. There might  be other risks we do not know about yet.  It is important that you talk to your  doctor, nurse or genetic counselor if you have questions or concerns about the  research study.       E.  POSSIBLE BENEFITS:  There are no direct benefits to you by participating in this study. However, it is hoped  that the information gained from the study will help in understanding the impact of  OSAS on memory and other aspects of cognitive functioning in early postmenopausal  women and would lay the groundwork to perform future larger studies utilizing fMRI to  study the brain in these patients.    F. COSTS:  There will be no direct cost to you to participate in this research study, other than  transportation costs to and from CBI. There will be no additional costs to you for  obtaining and storing your sample for future research.         IRB Number: Pro00025410 Date Approved 6/16/2015  Expiration Date: 6/15/2016  Page 9 of 11        Version 05/07/2013    G.  PAYMENT TO PARTICIPANTS:  In return for your time and effort, you will be paid $50 for completing this study. Should  you choose to end your participation early, you will receive a partial payment of $12.50  for each half an hour completed. Compensation will be provided by check, which will be  mailed to you.    You may also receive, upon request, a CD of images of your brain at no cost to you.  These images are provided for your personal use. While these images have the  potential to reveal a medical condition, only a medical professional can use them for  diagnostic purposes. Please be aware that no medical professional has reviewed, or will  review, these images as part of any Medical University of South Carolina research  protocol or for purposes of making any diagnosis of your medical condition. If you are  concerned that there is something in the images that warrants medical attention you  should take the images to your primary physician. We will be pleased to provide  duplicates of the images upon request of a medical professional, if needed. These  images are not accompanied by any personal information about you, in keeping with the  regulation that all identifying information about you is kept confidential and secure.     Payments that you receive from MUSC for participating in a research study are  considered taxable income per IRS regulations.  Payment types may include, but are  not limited to: checks, cash, gift certificates/cards, personal property, and other items of  value.  If the total amount of payment you receive from MUSC reaches or exceeds  $600.00 in a calendar year, you will be issued a Form 1099.      Your blood sample will not be sold to researchers.  It is possible that your donated  sample may result in new inventions or discoveries that may have commercial value.   You will not be paid for the use of your donated sample.      H. ALTERNATIVES:  You have the option not to participate in this study. Medical treatment for your condition  will not change in any way due to your decision about participating in this study.      I.

south carolina consent to be a research subject cognitive impairment and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome in post- menopausal women a. purpose: you are being asked to volunteer for a research study. this research is sponsored by the medical university of south carolina s (musc) scor (specialized center of research) on sex and gender factors affecting women s health. the purpose of this study is to understand how obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (osas) affects memory and other aspects of brain function in early postmenopausal women. osas is a sleep disorder in which patients have abnormal pauses in their breathing during sleep which can be associated with a decrease in blood oxygen levels. osas has several adverse effects on health including heart disease, stroke, fatigue and excessive daytime sleepiness. you are being asked to participate in this study because you are a postmenopausal woman between 45-60 years of age, within 5 years of having achieved natural menopause and either have osas or have a high likelihood of having osas. your participation in this project will help to see how well functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri) can measure your brain s activity as you perform memory and attention tasks while in the scanner. it is hoped that the data collected in this study will lead to future fmri studies to better understand the impact of obstructive sleep apnea on the brain. another purpose of this study is to collect blood samples (plasma, dna and rna) for future research to learn more about preventing, diagnosing, and treating diseases. the investigators in charge of this study are dr. chitra lal and dr. jane joseph. there may be other people on the research team assisting at different times during the study. the fmri scanning is being done at the center for biomedical imaging (cbi) on 30 bee street on the medical university of south carolina campus and will involve approximately 10 volunteers. b. procedures: if you agree to be in this study, the following will happen: 1. you will go to cbi on 30 bee street at a time that you have scheduled with one of the research team members. after you provide your consent, you will undergo the following procedures that take about 30 minutes: a. you will be tested for normal visual function using tests that an eye doctor would perform. b. you will fill out a questionnaire about what hand you prefer to use for different everyday tasks and will complete standard vocabulary tests. irb number: pro00025410 date approved 6/16/2015 expiration date: 6/15/2016 page 2 of 11 version 05/07/2013 c. you will fill out a questionnaire asking whether you have any metal in your body as well as any other medical conditions that may need to be considered for you to enter the fmri scanner, which will be used to take pictures of your brain. the metal screening questionnaire will be reviewed by the individual operating the mri scanner and if any risks are identified, you may not be able to participate. d. you will be asked to provide a urine sample to screen for pregnancy before going into the fmri scanner. if the results are positive, you will not be able to participate. 2. after the screening session, you will sit in front of a computer in a quiet room at cbi to practice the tasks that you will be asked to perform while in the fmri scanner. you will perform some brief tests of attention and memory for about 5 minutes. you will practice two attention tasks for about 5 minutes and practice two memory tasks for about 3 minutes. these tests record how accurately and quickly you respond to visual stimuli and make simple choices and decisions. . 3. after the practice session, you will be asked to perform simple visual and memory tasks outside of the fmri scanner. this will last about 30 minutes. 	 4. you will be taken to the fmri scanner by the research team member. in the interest of your individual safety, the safety of others, and to prevent damage to the equipment itself, you will be asked to remove all jewelry, body piercings, hair accessories, belts, wallets, credit cards, and loose change and leave these items with the experimenter. you will then be instructed about specific fmri procedures, which include the need to remain still while in the scanner, the need to remain attentive and awake during the study and how we will communicate with you while you are in the fmri scanner. you will then lie down on your back on a narrow bed, which will then be placed in a tunnel that is 6 feet by 22 inches wide and open at each end. the experimenter will take a few minutes to make sure you are positioned correctly, have on ear protection and are comfortable. after you are in the scanner, the experimenter will go to the control room and communicate with you through an intercom system. the experimenter will be able to see you at all times and will check with you through the intercom to make sure you are ok. this will last about 5-10 minutes. 5. once the fmri scanner starts, you will look at pictures or letters on a screen that you view through a mirror while you are laying down. just like you practiced earlier, you will respond to the pictures by pressing buttons. you will try to lay as still as you can and try not to talk unless asked to do so by the experimenter. you will hear loud noises from the scanner. fmri scanning will take 45 minutes to an irb number: pro00025410 date approved 6/16/2015 expiration date: 6/15/2016 page 3 of 11 version 05/07/2013 hour to complete. once fmri scanning is complete, you will be taken out of the scanner. 6. a blood sample will be drawn from you by inserting a needle in your arm as part of the study on the second floor of the clinical sciences building of musc. study personnel will take you from cbi to the clinical sciences building for this purpose. for this study, a maximum of three tubes of blood (30 ml or 2 tablespoons) will be drawn. this process will take approximately 30 minutes the sample (plasma, dna, rna) will be stored in the musc biomedical bank for future research to learn about, prevent, treat, and cure any type of health problem. it will be used to gather information about you and your disease and genetic information (dna, rna) may be obtained from the material. information and results about your sample will not be added to your medical records. the blood will be biobanked for future research and will not be analyzed as part of this study. you have the option to not participate in the banking of blood portion of the study. do you wish to provide your blood sample for this study yes no please read each sentence below and think about your choice. after reading each sentence, initial by ""yes"" or ""no."" 1. my sample may be used for genetic future research to learn about, prevent, treat, or cure disease. yes  no 2. my sample may be kept for use in future research to learn about, prevent, treat, or cure disease. i understand this may involve providing the samples

problems (for example: causes of diabetes, alzheimer's disease, and heart disease). i understand this may involve providing the samples to other researchers. yes  no 	 7. you may be withdrawn from the study without your consent if the researchers believe it is in your best interest or if you fail to follow study procedures. you are also free to withdraw from the study at any time. if you choose to withdraw from the study, the blood sample that has been collected and not yet used in research will be removed from the biobank and at that time will be destroyed. no additional samples will be collected. we ask that you contact dr. lal in writing to let her know you are withdrawing your permission for your blood samples to be used for future research. her mailing address is: chitra lal, md,

(843)792-7776 c. duration: you will complete one visit that will last about two hours. your blood sample will be collected as a one-time blood draw for future research use and stored in the musc biomedical bank for up to one year after the study termination. after one year the sample will be stored in the pulmonary division on the 8th floor of the clinical sciences building at musc for an unknown period of time, or until the sample is all gone. d. possible discomforts or risks: 1. fmri: because the fmri machine acts like a large magnet, it could move iron- containing objects in the mri room during your examination, which could in the process possibly harm you. precautions have been taken to prevent such an event from happening; loose metal objects, like pocket knives or key chains, are not allowed in the mri room. if you have a piece of metal in your body (excluding dental fillings or some types of permanent retainers), such as a fragment in your eye, some types of tattoos, permanent makeup, shrapnel, or fragments from welding, aneurysm clips, ear implants, spinal nerve stimulators, or a pacemaker, you will not be allowed into the mri room and cannot have a mri. irb number: pro00025410 date approved 6/16/2015 expiration date: 6/15/2016 page 5 of 11 version 05/07/2013 having a mri may mean some added discomfort to you. you may be bothered by feelings of claustrophobia. if you do not like enclosed spaces, you should not participate in this study. you may feel dizzy or nauseous if you move too quickly going into or coming out of the scanner. the scanner bed moves slowly to prevent this. the loud banging noise of the mri scanner may bother you. temporary hearing loss has been reported from the loud noise. this is why you will be asked to wear ear protection. you may experience dry or irritated eyes or discomfort from lying on your back for an extended period. let the experimenter know if you need more cushions or support that will make you feel more comfortable. you may also experience boredom or sleepiness while in the mri scanner. 2. incidental findings: brain images collected for research purposes as part of the study could reveal some type of brain abnormality or pathology. this occurs very rarely but could be serious. this study collects pictures of the brain for research purposes only and not for medical diagnosis. however, in the process of collecting brain images for research purposes, the experimenters may notice an abnormality. in this case, they will contact you and describe their observations and, if the cd was not initially requested, we will give the images of your brain to you directly. you may share these with your primary care physician, if you so choose. 3. pregnancy: the risk of exposing an unborn child to a strong magnetic field is not known. therefore, if you are pregnant, or suspect that you might be pregnant, you cannot participate in this study. prior to your participation in this study, you will take a urine pregnancy test. 4. breach of confidentiality: the researchers realize that there are also non- physical risks associated with taking part in this study such as the accidental disclosure of research data, which could result in such things as discrimination by employers or insurance providers. the chance that research data would be released is very small and every attempt will be made to protect your confidential participation in this study. any information collected and results of behavioral, and mri tests are coded with numbers and/or initials. your name, phone number, address (or any other information uniquely identifying you) will not be written on or associated with the information collected. the investigator and staff are the only people who know your personal information (name, phone number and address).	 	 information resulting from the research will not be entered into your medical records. your health and genetic information obtained from your blood (plasma, dna, rna) sample will also be handled in a way that is sensitive to your confidential information. your name and any other information that directly identifies you will be removed from any specimen containers. the information about your identity irb number: pro00025410 date approved 6/16/2015 expiration date: 6/15/2016 page 6 of 11 version 05/07/2013 will be replaced with a coded number. a list that links the coded number to your name, medical record number and date the sample was collected will be kept in a locked, secure location. this information will only be known to people who are a part of this project, the biobank staff or to future researchers if approved for use by a review board that protects people in research. your material will be stored with this coded number so that it can be used to document that the sample came from you and can be used to link the samples to you and to your medical record information. 5. blood draw: risks associated with drawing blood from your arm include momentary discomfort and/or bruising. infection, excess bleeding, clotting or fainting are also possible, although unlikely. 6. other risks: in addition to the risks listed above, you may experience a previously unknown risk or side effect. 7. genetic research: research to identify genes that cause or contribute to a disease or trait is an increasingly important way to try to understand the role of genes in human disease. you have been given this consent form because the medical university of south carolina investigators want to include your blood sample (plasma, dna, rna) in a research project, or because they want to save such biological samples for future research. there are several things you should know before allowing your blood to be studied or to be stored. 1. your blood sample (plasma, dna, rna) will be stored under your name or some other type of identifier, which could be linked to you. sometimes these samples are shared for research purposes with other investigators at other research sites. if this is done, the other investigators would not know your name. 2. in addition to your name, other information about you might be connected to your blood (plasma, dna, rna) sample. for instance, information about race, ethnicity, sex, your medical history, and so forth might be available to investigators studying your blood (plasma, dna, rna). such information is important for scientific reasons and sometimes for public health. it is possible that genetic information will come to be associated with your racial or ethnic group. 3. genetic information about you will often apply (in one degree or another) to family members. it is not generally the university s policy to provide genetic information about you to your family members. however, certain studies, called ""pedigree studies"", share such information among family members. for this and related research you will be asked if you are willing to share your genetic information with your family members. irb number: pro00025410 date approved 6/16/2015 expiration date: 6/15/2016 page 7 of 11 version 05/07/2013 4. you have the right to refuse to allow your blood sample to be studied or saved for future research studies. you may withdraw from this study at any time and remove any samples that contain identifiers from research use after the date of your withdrawal. this means that while the university might retain the identified samples, the law often requires that the samples would not be used for research. 5. south carolina law mandates that your genetic information obtained from any tests or from this research, be kept confidential. our state law prohibits any insurer using this information in a discriminatory manner against you or any of your family in issuing or renewing insurance coverage for you or your family. our state law further prohibits our sharing your genetic information with anyone except in a few narrow circumstances, one of these being a research project of this type, approved by the institutional review board and then we must take all steps to protect your identity. you will still be responsible for paying for health care, however. the medical university of south carolina will not be responsible for such costs, even if care is needed for a condition revealed during research or clinical testing. 6. genetic research raises difficult questions about informing you and other subjects of any results, or of future results. some people feel anxious about the possibility of having a defective gene that would place them or their children at risk. some people want to know what is found out about them; others do not. the risks of knowing include anxiety and other psychological distress. the risks of not knowing what is found include not being aware if there is treatment for the problem being studied. however, these risks can change depending on whether there is a treatment or cure for a particular disease, and on how clear the results are. if there is a medical reason to seek specific information from you, your doctor will tell you this. a process called ""genetic counseling"" is often appropriate in such cases; you should ask your doctor or nurse about this if you have any questions. in this study, investigators will not tell you what they find out about you, nor will they contact you if a test becomes available to diagnose a condition you might have or later develop. future investigators may try to re-contact you later to find out about your health. if you are re-contacted and want to know what these future investigators have learned about your samples, you should understand that the following are the kinds of things the investigators or your health team might tell you: a) information is too unclear to give you particular details, but you will receive a newsletter informing you about the results of the project. irb number: pro00025410 date approved 6/16/2015 expiration date: 6/15/2016 page 8 of 11 version 05/07/2013 b) you carry a gene for a particular disease that can be treated. c) you can carry a gene for a particular disease for which there is no current treatment. this news might cause severe anxiety or other psychological distress, depending on the severity of the disease. d) you carry a gene for a disease and might consider informing relatives that they, too, might carry the gene. it can be very difficult to decide whether to share such information with relatives. genetic counselors can help sort out the various options in such a case. in addition, for any future research, the investigator may contact you with a new consent form giving you additional information. 7. if you are concerned about a potential genetic disorder, you and your doctor might choose to test specifically for it. this would require additional blood or tissue samples and would not be part of this research project. you should discuss this option with your doctor or genetic counselor. 8. the presence of a genetic marker does not necessarily mean that an individual will develop a disease. informing people of all such markers independently of medical need can cause unnecessary anxiety. on the other hand, the absence of a marker does not mean that someone will not get the disease. genetic diseases appear because of a complex mixture of hereditary, environmental, behavioral and other factors. these are the best-known risks and challenges of genetic research. there might be other risks we do not know about yet. it is important that you talk to your doctor, nurse or genetic counselor if you have questions or concerns about the research study. e. possible benefits: there are no direct benefits to you by participating in this study. however, it is hoped that the information gained from the study will help in understanding the impact of osas on memory and other aspects of cognitive functioning in early postmenopausal women and would lay the groundwork to perform future larger studies utilizing fmri to study the brain in these patients. f. costs: there will be no direct cost to you to participate in this research study, other than transportation costs to and from cbi. there will be no additional costs to you for obtaining and storing your sample for future research. irb number: pro00025410 date approved 6/16/2015 expiration date: 6/15/2016 page 9 of 11 version 05/07/2013 g. payment to participants: in return for your time and effort, you will be paid $50 for completing this study. should you choose to end your participation early, you will receive a partial payment of $12.50 for each half an hour completed. compensation will be provided by check, which will be mailed to you. you may also receive, upon request, a cd of images of your brain at no cost to you. these images are provided for your personal use. while these images have the potential to reveal a medical condition, only a medical professional can use them for diagnostic purposes. please be aware that no medical professional has reviewed, or will review, these images as part of any medical university of south carolina research protocol or for purposes of making any diagnosis of your medical condition. if you are concerned that there is something in the images that warrants medical attention you should take the images to your primary physician. we will

2019-05-13,../data//MCRC consent pts-8May15-STAMPED,../data//MCRC consent pts-8May15-STAMPED.txt,"Page 1 of 8 Version 05/08/2015    Medical University of South Carolina  CONSENT TO BE A RESEARCH SUBJECT  Patient Participant    The Multidisciplinary Clinical Research Center for  Rheumatic Diseases in African Americans    In statements below, the word ""you"" refers to you or to your child or  adolescent who is being asked to participate in this study.    If you are under 18 years of age: 1) Your parent or legal guardian will be  present when this informed consent form is presented to you; and 2) You  will be able to participate only if your parent or legal guardian provides  permission (and, if you are 10 to 17 years old, you also agree).     A.  PURPOSE AND BACKGROUND:    You are being asked to volunteer for a research study at MUSC sponsored by a grant  from the National Institutes of Health.  The goal of this grant is to learn more about the  development of lupus (Systemic Lupus Erythematosus; SLE), scleroderma (Systemic  Sclerosis), and other rheumatic diseases which affect African-Americans more than  other groups.  You are being asked to participate because you are a patient with  probable or definite lupus or scleroderma.    Information about your social, family, medical and medications history, physical exam  findings, and lab test reports will be collected and stored in a computerized database for  analysis.  In addition to those used for the purposes of diagnosis and treatment, extra  samples of blood, urine, tissue, and saliva may be collected for research purposes.   This is a long-term, open-ended project.  We hope that information gathered in the  database combined with laboratory examination of your samples will provide more  information about the causes and treatments of lupus and scleroderma. Dr. Gary  Gilkeson is in charge of the overall study. This study is being done at the Medical  University of South Carolina and will involve approximately 910 volunteers.    B.  PROCEDURES:     If you agree to participate the following will happen: We will review your medical record  to confirm you meet the eligibility criteria for the study and confirm you have a prior  diagnosis of lupus or scleroderma. Your physician will record your medical history and  physical examination findings in both your medical record and the database.  You will  be asked to fill out questionnaires about your physical health, and medical history.  This  information is collected in the normal course of a medical evaluation.  You will also be  asked to complete questionnaires about your home and work environment, diet, and  sleep patterns. If you choose, we can send the questionnaires to you by mail for you to    IRB Number: Pro00021985  Date Approved 11/17/2015  MCRC consent pts 8May15.doc Expiration Date: 11/16/2016  Page 2 of 8 Version 05/08/2015    return to us. With your permission, we can also send the questionnaires to you by email  through a secure electronic survey program.  At each visit, you may be asked for a  blood sample and to provide the same amount of urine in addition to the amount you  give for regular monitoring of your disease. About 6 ½ tablespoons or 95cc of blood will  be drawn from adults, and no more than 3cc per kilogram weight for children.  During a  clinic visit, children who are not required to provide blood for normal medical care will  not be asked to give blood for research purposes.  You may also be asked to provide  cheek cells, which involves rubbing a small swab firmly against the inside of each cheek  six times, and a small amount of saliva (about ½ teaspoon or 2cc) which is collected by  spitting into a tube.  At each visit your clinical information will be updated; we may need  to review your medical record to do this.  By signing this form, you are giving permission  to have the information collected about you used for research purposes.  Your samples  may also be used in genome-wide association studies that look at the genetic  differences that exist in the complete set of human genes, and the association between  these differences and health conditions.      C.  DURATION:    We may need to review your medical record to update your clinical information each  time you visit. The duration of participation in this study is 30-60 minutes per clinic visit,  for as long as you are under the care of MUSC for your disease, or as long as this study  continues (5 years).  We will collect samples for research purposes no more than every  3 months, even if you have clinic appointments with your physician more frequently.     D.  RISKS/DISCOMFORTS:     Blood tests: The risks of drawing blood include temporary discomfort from the needle  stick, bruising and infection. Fainting could occur but is rare.    Genetic research on biological samples: The investigators involved in this study may  want to isolate genetic material (DNA and/or RNA) and serum from your blood in order  to identify genes or proteins that may predispose individuals to develop scleroderma,  lupus or similar diseases or may influence disease outcome or how individuals respond  to treatment. When this study is complete the researchers may wish to perform  additional tests on these samples. All samples will be stored in refrigerators and  freezers in secured buildings at MUSC and all stored samples will be identified by codes  defined by investigators in the study.    Research to identify genes that cause or contribute to a disease or trait is an   increasingly important way to try to understand the role of genes in human disease.   You have been given this consent form because the Medical University of South  Carolina investigators want to include your tissue, cell or blood sample in a research  project, or because they want to save such biological samples for future research.   There are several things you should know before allowing your tissues, cells or blood to    IRB Number: Pro00021985  Date Approved 11/17/2015  MCRC consent pts 8May15.doc Expiration Date: 11/16/2016  Page 3 of 8 Version 05/08/2015    be studied or to be stored.    1. Your tissue, cell or blood sample will be stored under your name or some other type  of identifier which could be linked to you. Sometimes these samples are shared for  research purposes with other investigators at other research sites. If this is done, the  other investigators would not know your name.    2. In addition to your name, other information about you might be connected to your  blood or tissue sample. For instance, information about race, ethnicity, sex, your  medical history, and so forth might be available to investigators studying your tissue or  blood. Such information is important for scientific reasons and sometimes for public  health. It is possible that genetic information might come to be associated with your  racial or ethnic group.    3. Genetic information about you will often apply (in one degree or another) to family  members. It is not generally the University’s policy to provide genetic information about  you to your family members. However, certain studies, called “pedigree studies”, share  such information among family members. For this and related research you will be  asked if you are willing to share your genetic information with your family members.    4. You have the right to refuse to allow your tissue or blood to be studied or saved for  future research studies. You may withdraw from this study at any time and remove any  samples that contain identifiers from research use after the date of your withdrawal.  This means that while the University might retain the identified samples - the law often  requires this - they would not be used for research.    5. South Carolina law mandates that your genetic information obtained from any tests or  from this research, be kept confidential. Our state law prohibits any insurer using this  information in a discriminatory manner against you or any of your family in issuing or  renewing insurance coverage for you or your family. Our state law further prohibits our  sharing your genetic information with anyone except in a few narrow circumstances,  one of these being a research project of this type, approved by the Institutional Review  Board and then we must take all steps to protect your identity. You will still be  responsible for paying for health care, however. The Medical University of South  Carolina will not be responsible for such costs, even if care is needed for a condition  revealed during research or clinical testing.    6. Genetic research raises difficult questions about informing you and other subjects of  any results, or of future results. Some people feel anxious about the possibility of having  a defective gene that would place them or their children at risk. Some people want to  know what is found out about them; others do not.  The risks of knowing include anxiety  and other psychological distress. The risks of not knowing what is found include not  being aware if there is treatment for the problem being studied. But these risks can  change depending on whether there is a treatment or cure for a particular disease, and    IRB Number: Pro00021985  Date Approved 11/17/2015  MCRC consent pts 8May15.doc Expiration Date: 11/16/2016  Page 4 of 8 Version 05/08/2015    on how clear the results are.  If there is a medical reason to seek specific information  from you, your doctor will tell you this. A process called “genetic counseling” is often  appropriate in such cases; you should ask your doctor or nurse about this if you have  any questions.    In this study, investigators will not tell you what they find out about you, nor will  they contact you if a test becomes available to diagnose a condition you might  have or later develop.    7. If you are concerned about a potential genetic disorder, you and your doctor might  choose to test specifically for it. This would require additional blood or tissue samples  and would not be part of this research project. You should discuss this option with your  doctor or genetic counselor.    8. The presence of a genetic marker does not necessarily mean that an individual will  develop a disease. Informing people of all such markers independently of medical need  can cause unnecessary anxiety. On the other hand, the absence of a marker does not  mean that someone will not get the disease. Genetic diseases appear as a result of a  complex mixture of hereditary, environmental, behavioral and other factors.    Genome-wide samples:  Your DNA may be used in genome-wide association studies  and in studies involving whole genome / exome sequencing.  These studies may involve  investigators at other institutions. Genome-wide association studies look at the genetic  differences that exist in the complete set of human genes and the association between  these differences and health conditions.  The following are explanations of whole  genome and whole exome sequencing:     Whole genome sequencing (also known as full genome sequencing) is a test that  determines your entire genetic code, called your genome. Every cell in your body  contains this code spelled out in your DNA, designated by the letters A, T, C, and G.  All people have very similar genomes – about 99.6 percent identical – consisting of  approximately six billion letters. However, everyone is unique and between any two  people there could be approximately 24 million places where the spelling is different.  By looking at your genome and comparing it to the genomes of other populations  with and without disease, we may be able to identify places where your genomes  don’t match-up. These newly-identified places could be associated with a disease  such as scleroderma or lupus. This information will allow us to focus on areas of  your genome that are good candidates for more investigation.      Your DNA may also be used for whole exome sequencing. Your genome consists of  genes, short segments of DNA that code for proteins, and many long segments of  DNA that do not contain genes. The places on the genome that contain genes are  called exons. Scientists use the term “exome” to represent all of the exons, or  protein-coding regions, of the genome. Whole exome sequencing is similar to whole    IRB Number: Pro00021985  Date Approved 11/17/2015  MCRC consent pts 8May15.doc Expiration Date: 11/16/2016  Page 5 of 8 Version 05/08/2015    genome sequencing in that it looks at the entire genome, but whole exome  sequencing only records the gene regions of the genome.    As part of this study, we will be collecting information about your health and your  individual genes.  This information will be sent to the National Institutes of Health (NIH)  GWAS database called dbGAP (Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes). No personal  information that could identify you will be sent to the NIH.    These are the best-known risks and challenges of genetic research. There might be  other risks we do not know about yet.  It is important that you talk to your doctor, nurse  or genetic counselor if you have questions or concerns about the research study.    Please initial in one space in each box below to indicate your choices.   Your  choices will not affect your ability to participate in this research project:       Non-genetic research:    _____ Yes, you may store my blood, urine, tissue, and saliva for future non-genetic  research.  My samples will be labeled with a code that can be linked back to  identifying information.  This may involve investigators at other institutions.     _____ No, you may not store my blood and urine for future non-genetic research.        Genetic research:    _____ Yes, you may use my DNA for genetic research on lupus, scleroderma, and other  diseases, including genome-wide association studies. My samples will be labeled  with a code that can be linked back to identifying information.  This may involve  investigators at other institutions.    _____ No, you may not use my DNA for genetic research.        Contact for future research studies:    _____ Yes, the study team may contact me in the future about future studies.    _____ No, I do not want to be contacted about future studies.        If you are a minor, we will ask you to re-consent to participating in this research when    IRB Number: Pro00021985  Date Approved 11/17/2015  MCRC consent pts 8May15.doc Expiration Date: 11/16/2016  Page 6 of 8 Version 05/08/2015    you are 18 years old.  If you decide you would like to withdraw your samples you should  contact the Principal Investigator and we will locate and destroy any unanalyzed  samples you have donated as a part of this study.  His contact information is:    Gary Gilkeson MD  Medical University of South Carolina  Division of Rhuematology and Immunology  96 Jonathan Lucas Street, MSC 637  Charleston, SC 29425  Phone number (843) 792-1991    Your samples will be stored in MUSC freezers without any information that identifies  you.  They will be kept indefinitely.  They will be available only to authorized study  personnel, and may be made available to future researchers if approved for use by a  review board that protects people in research.    Confidentiality: There is the potential risk of loss of confidentiality.  Every effort will be  made to keep your information confidential; however, this cannot be guaranteed.  The  information we collect from you will be stored in a computerized database and will be  assigned a number which is different than your medical record number. Only  investigators and key personnel will have access to this information.  Your name and  any other information that identifies you will be removed from any sample containers,  and replaced with a coded number.  A list that links the coded number to your name,  medical record number and date the sample was collected will be kept in a locked,  secure location.  This information will only be known to people who are a part of the  MCRC research staff, the MUSC Biomedical Bank or to future researchers if approved  for use by a review board that protects people in research.      E.  BENEFITS:    There will be no direct benefit to you from participating in this study. However, it is  hoped that the information gained from the study will help the research team learn more  about lupus and scleroderma and may be beneficial to you or others in the future.    F.  COSTS:    There is no cost for your participation and you will not be charged for procedures that  are specific to this research study.  In the course of your normal treatment you may be  asked to regularly have blood samples taken and undergo regular physical  examinations. Some of these charges may be billed to you or your insurance company  because they are considered routine care for your disease (for instance, urinalysis, c3,  c4 anti-dsDNA, platelets, white blood cells, hemoglobin levels).

K.  RELEASE OF MEDICAL RECORDS TO ANYONE OTHER THAN THE  INVESTIGATORS:    You will be asked to sign a separate release for the release of your medical records.    Results of this research will be used for the purposes described in this study. This  information may be published, but you will not be identified. Information that is obtained  concerning this research that can be identified with you will remain confidential to the  extent possible within State and Federal law. The investigators associated with this  study, the sponsor, and the MUSC Institutional Review Board for Human Research will  have access to identifying information. All records in South Carolina are subject to  subpoena by a court of law.     In the event that you are injured as a result of participation in this study, you should  immediately go to the emergency room of the Medical University Hospital, or in case of  an emergency go to the nearest hospital, and tell the physician on call that you are in a  research study. They will call your study doctor who will make arrangements for your  treatment. If the study sponsor does not pay for your treatment, the Medical University  Hospital and the physicians who render treatment to you will bill your insurance  company. If your insurance company denies coverage or insurance is not available, you  will be responsible for payment for all services rendered to you.     Your participation in this study is voluntary. You may refuse to take part in or stop taking  part in this study at any time. You should call the investigator in charge of this study if  you decide to do this. Your decision not to take part in the study will not affect your  current or future medical care or any benefits to which you are entitled.

know what is found out about them; others do not. the risks of knowing include anxiety and other psychological distress. the risks of not knowing what is found include not being aware if there is treatment for the problem being studied. but these risks can change depending on whether there is a treatment or cure for a particular disease, and irb number: pro00021985 date approved 11/17/2015 mcrc consent pts 8may15.doc expiration date: 11/16/2016 page 4 of 8 version 05/08/2015 on how clear the results are. if there is a medical reason to seek specific information from you, your doctor will tell you this. a process called genetic counseling is often appropriate in such cases; you should ask your doctor or nurse about this if you have any questions. in this study, investigators will not tell you what they find out about you, nor will they contact you if a test becomes available to diagnose a condition you might have or later develop. 7. if you are concerned about a potential genetic disorder, you and your doctor might choose to test specifically for it. this would require additional blood or tissue samples and would not be part of this research project. you should discuss this option with your doctor or genetic counselor. 8. the presence of a genetic marker does not necessarily mean that an individual will develop a disease. informing people of all such markers independently of medical need can cause unnecessary anxiety. on the other hand, the absence of a marker does not mean that someone will not get the disease. genetic diseases appear as a result of a complex mixture of hereditary, environmental, behavioral and other factors. genome-wide samples: your dna may be used in genome-wide association studies and in studies involving whole genome / exome sequencing. these studies may involve investigators at other institutions. genome-wide association studies look at the genetic differences that exist in the complete set of human genes and the association between these differences and health conditions. the following are explanations of whole genome and whole exome sequencing: whole genome sequencing (also known as full genome sequencing) is a test that determines your entire genetic code, called your genome. every cell in your body contains this code spelled out in your dna, designated by the letters a, t, c, and g. all people have very similar genomes about 99.6 percent identical consisting of approximately six billion letters. however, everyone is unique and between any two people there could be approximately 24 million places where the spelling is different. by looking at your genome and comparing it to the genomes of other populations with and without disease, we may be able to identify places where your genomes don t match-up. these newly-identified places could be associated with a disease such as scleroderma or lupus. this information will allow us to focus on areas of your genome that are good candidates for more investigation. your dna may also be used for whole exome sequencing. your genome consists of genes, short segments of dna that code for proteins, and many long segments of dna that do not contain genes. the places on the genome that contain genes are called exons. scientists use the term exome to represent all of the exons, or protein-coding regions, of the genome. whole exome sequencing is similar to whole irb number: pro00021985 date approved 11/17/2015 mcrc consent pts 8may15.doc expiration date: 11/16/2016 page 5 of 8 version 05/08/2015 genome sequencing in that it looks at the entire genome, but whole exome sequencing only records the gene regions of the genome. as part of this study, we will be collecting information about your health and your individual genes. this information will be sent to the national institutes of health (nih) gwas database called dbgap (database of genotypes and phenotypes). no personal information that could identify you will be sent to the nih. these are the best-known risks and challenges of genetic research. there might be other risks we do not know about yet. it is important that you talk to your doctor, nurse or genetic counselor if you have questions or concerns about the research study. please initial in one space in each box below to indicate your choices. your choices will not affect your ability to participate in this research project: non-genetic research:  yes, you may store my blood, urine, tissue, and saliva for future non-genetic research. my samples will be labeled with a code that can be linked back

2019-05-13,../data//SUSampCons-bd,../data//SUSampCons-bd.txt,"﻿SAMPLE CONSENT For Research Involving Blood Draw  DESCRIPTION:  You are invited to participate in a research study on heart disease.  We believe some fats in the blood damage the heart more than other fats.  We want to see if the types of fat in the blood are different between people who have had a heart attack within the past 6 months and people who have not.  PROCEDURES:  You will be asked to provide a sample of blood (1 tablespoon).  The blood will be taken with a needle and from your arm at the same time you are having blood drawn for your standard clinic visit.   After we complete our tests, we would like to save any left-over blood for future research on diabetes and heart disease.  Your blood sample will be frozen and will be stored with a number assigned to it instead of your name.  The number will be linked to your name, which means you can withdraw from this study at any time.    The future use of your blood in research may result in new products, tests or discoveries which may have potential commercial value.  Donors of tissues do not retain any property rights to the materials.  As such, you would not share in any financial benefits from these products, tests or discoveries.  The results of the study of your samples will be used for research purposes only and you will not be told the results of the tests.   	_____ I consent to my samples being saved for future research  	_____ I do not consent to my samples being saved for future research  Include the following language if samples in study will be used for genetic testing or if future research on samples will include genetic testing: Tissue Sampling for Genetic Testing  As part of the analysis on your samples, the investigators will do genetic testing.  Genetic research is research that studies genes, including gene characteristics and gene versions that are transmitted by parents to children.  Genetic research may include looking at information, such as personal appearance and biochemistry, gene sequences, genetic landmarks, individual and family medical histories, reactions to medications and responses to treatment.  Genetic research raises certain questions about informing you of any results.  Possible risks of knowing results include:  anxiety; other psychological distress; and the possibility of insurance and job discrimination.  A possible risk of not knowing includes being unaware of the need for treatment.  These risks can change depending on the results of the research and whether there is a treatment or cure for a particular disease.   Sometimes patients have been required to furnish information from genetic testing for health insurance, life insurance, and/or a job.  A Federal law, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (GINA), generally makes it illegal for health insurance companies, group health plans, and employers with 15 or more employees to discriminate against you based on your genetic information.  RISKS AND BENEFITS:  The risks associated with this study are slight discomfort or bruising from the blood draw and the possible loss of confidentiality if your data or information is inadvertently disclosed outside of this study. You will not benefit from the study, as this is not a treatment study.  We cannot and do not guarantee or promise that you will receive any benefits from this study.    TIME INVOLVEMENT: Your participation in this experiment will take approximately 15 minutes for the blood draw (which will be done as part of your annual visit).   PAYMENTS: You will not be paid to participate in this study.  PARTICIPANT'S RIGHTS: If you have read this form and have decided to participate in this project, please understand your participation is voluntary and you have the right to withdraw your consent or discontinue participation at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled.

study on heart disease. we believe some fats in the blood damage the heart more than other fats. we want to see if the types of fat in the blood are different between people who have had a heart attack within the past 6 months and people who have not. procedures: you will be asked to provide a sample of blood (1 tablespoon). the blood will be taken with a needle and from your arm at the same time you are having blood drawn for your standard clinic visit. after we complete our tests, we would like to save any left-over blood for future research on diabetes and heart disease. your blood sample will be frozen and will be stored with a number assigned to it instead of your name. the number will be linked to your name, which means you can withdraw from this study at any time. the future use of your blood in research may result in new products, tests or discoveries which may have potential commercial value. donors of tissues do not retain any property rights to the materials. as such, you would not share in any financial benefits from these products, tests or discoveries. the results of the study of your samples will be used for research purposes only and you will not be told the results of the tests. 	 i consent to my samples being saved for future research 	 i do not consent to my samples being saved for future research include the following language if samples in study will be used for genetic testing or if future research on samples will include genetic testing: tissue sampling for genetic testing as part of the analysis on your samples, the investigators will do genetic testing. genetic research is research that studies genes, including gene characteristics and gene versions that are transmitted by parents to children. genetic research may include looking at information, such as personal appearance and biochemistry, gene sequences, genetic landmarks, individual and family medical histories, reactions to medications and responses to treatment. genetic research raises certain questions about informing you of any results. possible risks of knowing results include: anxiety; other psychological distress; and the possibility of insurance and job discrimination. a possible risk of not knowing includes being unaware of the need for treatment. these risks can change depending on the results of the research and whether there is a treatment or cure for a particular disease. sometimes patients have been required to furnish information from genetic testing for health insurance, life insurance, and/or a job. a federal law, the genetic information nondiscrimination act of 2008 (gina), generally makes it illegal for health insurance companies, group health plans, and employers with 15 or more employees to discriminate against you based on your genetic information. risks and benefits: the risks associated with this study are slight discomfort or bruising from the blood draw and the possible loss of confidentiality if your data or information is inadvertently disclosed outside of this study. you will not benefit from the study, as this is not a treatment study. we cannot and do not guarantee or promise that you will receive any benefits from this study. time involvement: your participation in this experiment will take approximately 15 minutes for the blood draw (which will be done as part of your annual visit). payments:

Carey, PhD   For additional information, questions or problems contact:  Study Coordinator – (570) 214 - 5230  Dr. David J. Carey– (570) 271 - 6659  Geisinger Human Research Protection – (570) 271 - 8663     The consent process for this project includes this form and a participant information booklet. Additional  information is contained in the booklet wherever there is an asterisk (*).  Why are you being asked to participate in this research study?*  You are being invited to participate in this research because you had agreed previously to be part of the  MyCode research project and to be contacted to participate in future research studies.   We are enrolling approximately 1,000 participants in this study.  Why is this study being done?*  Your genes are made up of DNA. A gene, or DNA, contains information that determines in part the traits,  such as eye color, height, or disease risk, that are passed on from parent to child.  The goal of this study is to better understand how our genes (genetic information) affect our response  to certain prescription drugs and how that information can help doctors prescribe the right medications  for each patient. You are being asked to allow researchers to use your blood sample which we have  already collected from you as part of the MyCode project, to study your DNA to find out if you have  genetic variants that may:   Help your doctor determine if  you need a lower or higher dose of a prescription drug   Help your doctor determine if you are at an increased risk for side effects with certain  prescription drugs   Provide information your doctor might use to prescribe a different drug that is a better fit for  you  This study is also developing a way to place these test results in your medical record so that your doctor  can use them in the future if you were to be prescribed one of these drugs.        Version:6  Study: 2013-0156  Date: 04/01/2013  IRB NUMBER: 2013-0156 IRB Approved:  04/30/2013 What is involved in the study?*    We have already collected a blood sample from you as part of the MyCode project.  Participation in this project would involve testing that sample to see if you have a genetic factor  that may cause you to react unfavorably to a certain drug of interest if prescribed in the future.  This information would be placed in your electronic medical record.   Give us permission to put some of your genetic information (test results) in your Geisinger  electronic medical record. If you do not want your genetic information in your medical record,  you should NOT participate in this study.   Results from these tests may affect what medication and/or dose your doctor prescribes you in  the future.  How long will I be in this study?*  There is no specific end date for this study. It will probably be two years after you enroll before any  genetic information is put in your medical record. You may withdraw from the study at any time.  What are the risks of the study?*   Loss of confidentiality: There is a chance that someone outside the study staff or authorized  medical staff could learn your results. We will take multiple steps to reduce this risk.  No  identified information will be passed to anyone outside the Geisinger system.   Genetic testing may reveal some information that surprises or upsets you. You may be subject  to insurance or job discrimination. There is a Federal law, called the Genetic Information  Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) which provides some protection from insurance and job  discrimination.  Are there possible benefits from participating in this research study?   You may never need any of the medications we are studying and this information may provide  no benefit to you.   If you are prescribed one of the medications in the future, the information may help your  healthcare provider make better drug choices for you.  What other options are there?  Participating in this study is voluntary. You have the option not to participate in this study.  If you choose  not to participate in this study it will not affect your care at Geisinger.   The privacy of your information is a high priority and we will do our best to keep your information  confidential.  We cannot guarantee that your participation in this research project or the results of the  study will remain confidential. (See risk section.) No information that can identify you will be sent  outside of the Geisinger System.

Why are you being asked to take part in this research study?      You are being asked to take part in this research study because you are a Mayo Clinic Biobank  participant who lives in Olmsted County and uses Mayo Clinic for your healthcare.  We are  enrolling 1,000 Biobank participants in this study.      2. Why is this research study being done?      This research is being done to better understand how genetic information can affect medical care  of patients.     Genetic information is stored in segments called genes. Each of us has about 25,000 genes that  we inherit from our parents.  Genes are the instructions that tell our bodies how to grow and  develop.  Genes are made up of chemical letters known as DNA.  There are differences in the  DNA between people.  These differences are called genetic variants.     You are being asked to provide a blood sample so Mayo Clinic researchers can study your DNA  to find out if you have genetic variants that play a role in how your body responds to certain  prescription drugs. In this study, we are interested in genetic variants that may:        affect whether some people need a lower or higher dose of a prescription drug       affect whether some people are at an increased risk of side effects to a prescription drug    By doing this study, we are developing a way to incorporate information about prescription drug  related genetic variants into the medical record.  Some information about your genetic variants  will be put into your medical record so that can be used for your clinical care.  Furthermore, we  hope to identify new genetic variants related to how people’s bodies respond to prescription  drugs.    IRB#: Page 3 of 12 Version 1/2012             Name and Clinic Number           Approval Date:    Not to be used after:       3. What will happen to you while you are in this research study?    When you enroll in this study, you will:    Provide a sample of blood (about 4 tablespoons).      Give us permission to put some of your genetic information in your medical record.  If  you do not want your genetic information put in your medical record, you should  not participate in this study.  In the future, we will put some genetic information in your medical record.  This information  falls into three different categories:   1. Genetic variants that may affect how your body responds to certain prescription drugs.  Only genetic variants that are approved by the Mayo Clinic Pharmacy and  Therapeutic Committee will be put in your medical record. This expert committee  will approve variants that have been found to be important in determining drug dose  and use.  Genetic information not approved by this committee will be used for  research purposes only and will not go into your medical record.     It will probably be two years after you sign this consent form before any genetic  information is put in your medical record. This is how long it will likely take to  run the genetic tests, confirm the results, and develop the best way to put the  information in your medical record. The genetic information will not apply to all of  the medications you take.     Your genetic information will be available on your Mayo Clinic Online Patient  Account (located at www.mayoclinic.org). If you have questions about this genetic  information, you can contact the Center for Individualized Medicine Patient  Information Line at 507-XXX-XXXX or 1-866-XXX-XXXX (Toll Free).   2. Urgent Clinically Actionable Genetic Variants.   This study may find that you have one or more rare genetic variants that you and your  healthcare provider should know about.  An example of this is a condition called  malignant hyperthermia. When people with this condition get general anesthesia, their  body temperature rises causing severe muscle contractions. If this happens and they  IRB#: Page 4 of 12 Version 1/2012             Name and Clinic Number           Approval Date:    Not to be used after:     are not treated, they could die.  This could be prevented by using a different  anesthesia.    Experts in the Center for Individualized Medicine will decide which genetic variants  might require urgent clinical action. If any such genetic variants are found, you will  be contacted and your health care provider will be informed at no cost to you.  However, any costs associated with the clinical follow-up will be the responsibility of  you and your insurance provider.   3.  Non-Urgent Genetic Variants.  Through this study we may find additional genetic variants that relate to an increased  risk for specific health condition. Again, experts in the Center for Individualized  Medicine will identify those genetic variants for which you may be able to do  something to improve your health. If any of these are found, you will be contacted  and offered the option to learn these results through a free consultation with a genetic  counselor. You do not have to receive this information. It will be your choice. You  and/or your insurance provider will be responsible for any costs associated with  clinical follow-up related to this genetic information.  In the future, we also may:   Occasionally ask you to complete additional questionnaires or be interviewed. You may  decide at that time if you want to take part. You can always say no.      Offer you the option to participate in other studies. You can always say no.     Ask you for additional blood samples. Reasons for a new sample might include having  used up the first sample you provided or to run new tests. You can always say no.      4. How long will you be in this research study?    There is no specific end date for this study.  This study will build resources at Mayo Clinic to  incorporate genetic information into clinical care.  Therefore there is no intention to end the  study.  You are agreeing to be part of ongoing research surrounding drug related genetic  information at Mayo Clinic.  At some point in time, the Mayo Clinic Pharmacy and Therapeutics  Committee may determine that use of specific genetic variants related to prescription drugs is  IRB#: Page 5 of 12 Version 1/2012             Name and Clinic Number           Approval Date:    Not to be used after:     part of regular clinical care. At that time, your genetic information may no longer be considered  part of research, but instead, part of clinical care.     5. What are the possible risks or discomforts from being in this   research study?      Blood Draw Risks: The risks of drawing blood include pain, bruising, lightheadedness, and  fainting. Infection at the site of the needle stick is a rare side effect. These are the same risks you  face any time you have a blood test.   Confidentiality Risk: As with all research, there is a chance that the confidentiality of your  medical information could be compromised; however, we take precautions to decrease this risk.   Genetic Testing: The risks of learning genetic test results may include emotional upset or  insurance or job discrimination.   A Federal law, called the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA), makes it illegal  for health insurance companies, group health plans, and most employers to discriminate against  you based on your genetic information. This law will protect you in the following ways:     Health insurance companies and group health plans may not request your genetic  information that we get from this research.   Health insurance companies and group health plans may not use your genetic information  when making decisions regarding your eligibility or premiums.   Employers with 15 or more employees may not use your genetic information when  making a decision to hire, promote, or fire you or when setting the terms of your  employment.    All health insurance companies and group health plans must follow this law.    Be aware that this new Federal law doesn’t protect you against genetic discrimination by  companies that sell life insurance, disability insurance, or long-term care insurance. Members of  the US military may not have the same protections under this law. More information about  GINA can be found at www.ginahelp.org or you can ask a member of the research team to give  you additional details about GINA.   IRB#: Page 6 of 12 Version 1/2012             Name and Clinic Number           Approval Date:    Not to be used after:       6. What are the possible benefits from being in this research study?      This study may not make your health better.  The information provided by this research project,  may help your health care provider make better prescription drug choices for you. This may help  you avoid some prescription drug-related side effects or complications.        7. What if you want to leave this research study?      If you choose to withdraw from this study before your genetic information has been added to your  medical record:   no genetic information from this study will be added to your record, and    you will not be contacted again to provide new information or asked to participate in  additional studies related to this project.      If you withdraw after some of your genetic information has been added to your medical record:   your blood sample will be destroyed and no new genetic information will be added to your  medical record;    the genetic information from this study already in your medical record cannot legally be  deleted (it will be permanent).  However, the interpretation of your genetic information will  only be  updated as needed to ensure that your healthcare provider has the most accurate and  up-to-date information possible;    you will not be contacted again to provide new information or participate in additional  studies related to this project.    If you want to withdraw, contact the Center for Individualized Medicine Patient Information Line  at 507-XXX-XXXX, or toll-free at 1-XXX-XXX-XXXX or write to the following address and tell us  you wish to withdraw from the study.   Center for Individualized Medicine  ATTN: Notice of Revocation of Authorization for the RIGHT Protocol   200 1st Street SW   Rochester, MN 55905     IRB#: Page 7 of 12 Version 1/2012             Name and Clinic Number           Approval Date:    Not to be used after:         8. Will you be paid for taking part in this research study?      No, you will not be paid for taking part in this study.       9. What tests or procedures will you need to pay for if you take part in this  study?      You won’t need to pay the following;   blood draw   genetic tests   consultation with genetic counselor    However, you and/or your insurance will need to pay for all other tests and procedures that you  would have as part of your clinical care, including co-payments and deductibles. This includes  any follow-up procedures related to your genetic results that may be recommended by your  clinician or genetic counselor. If you decide to follow up, any further medical testing will be  considered part of your clinical care, and will not be paid for by the research study.       10. Who is funding the study?      This study is funded by National Human Genome Research Institute of the National Institutes of  Health, Mayo Clinic Center for Individualized Medicine and Mayo Clinic Center for the Science  of Health Care Delivery.        11. What will happen to your blood samples and information?        We will keep your blood sample for future research and possibly at other institutions. If you do  not want your blood sample to be used for future research, you should not take part in this study.        IRB#: Page 8 of 12 Version 1/2012             Name and Clinic Number           Approval Date:    Not to be used after:     Medical and Genetic Information   It is helpful for researchers to share information they get from studying human samples. They do  this by putting it into one or more scientific databases. The information is stored along with  information from other studies. Researchers can then study the shared information to learn even  more about health and disease. If you agree to take part in this study, some of your genetic and  health information may be placed into one or more national scientific databases, such as dbGaP.  Your name and other information that could directly identify you (such as address or social  security number) will never be placed into a scientific database. Because your genetic  information is unique to you, there is a small chance that someone could trace it back to you.   The risk of this happening is very small, but may grow in the future. Researchers will always  have a duty to protect your privacy and to keep your information confidential.     There is a very small chance that some commercial value may result from the use of your  donated sample or information.  If that happens, you won’t be offered a share in any profits.      12. How will your privacy and the confidentiality be protected?      Mayo Clinic is committed to protecting the confidentiality of information obtained about you in  connection with this research study. All of the written documents you provide will be stored in  locked cabinets or scanned into password protected computer files. The information entered into your  medical record will also be held to the high standards of confidentiality at Mayo Clinic. Your blood  sample will be identified only by a code number.   During this research, information about your health will be collected. Under Federal law called  the Privacy Rule, health information is private. However, there are exceptions to this rule, and  you should know who may be able to see, use and share your health information for research and  why they may need to do so. Information about you and your health cannot be used in this  research study without your written permission. If you sign this form, it will provide that  permission.     Health information may be collected about you from:     Past, present and future medical records.   Research procedures, including research office visits, tests, interviews and  questionnaires.    Why will this information be used and/or given to others?    IRB#: Page 9 of 12 Version 1/2012             Name and Clinic Number           Approval Date:    Not to be used after:      To do the research.   To report the results.   To see if the research was done correctly.    If the results of this study are made public, information that identifies you will not be used.    Who may use or share your health information?   Mayo Clinic research staff involved in this study.    Researchers using national scientific databases, such as dbGaP.    With whom may your health information be shared?    The Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board that oversees the research.    Other Mayo Clinic physicians involved in your clinical care.    Researchers involved in this study at other institutions.   Federal and State agencies (such as the Food and Drug Administration, the Department of  Health and Human Services, the National Institutes of Health and other US or  government agencies in other countries) that oversee or review research.    Is your health information protected after it has been shared with others?    Mayo Clinic asks anyone who receives your health information from us to protect your privacy,  however once your information is shared outside Mayo Clinic we cannot promise that it will  remain private and it may no longer be protected by the Privacy Rule.    Your Privacy Rights    You do not have to sign this form, but if you do not, you cannot take part in this research study.    If you cancel your permission to use or share your health information, your participation in this  study will end and no more information about you will be collected; however, information  already collected about you in the study may continue to be used.    If you choose not to take part or if you withdraw from this study, it will not harm your  relationship with your own doctors or with Mayo Clinic.    You can cancel your permission to use or share your health information at any time by sending a  letter to the address below:    Mayo Clinic  Office for Human Research Protection  IRB#: Page 10 of 12 Version 1/2012             Name and Clinic Number           Approval Date:    Not to be used after:     ATTN: Notice of Revocation of Authorization  200 1st Street SW  Rochester, MN 55905    Alternatively, you may cancel your permission by emailing the Mayo Clinic Research Subject  Advocate at: researchsubjectadvocate@mayo.edu    Please be sure to include in your letter or email:   The name of the Principal Investigator,   The study IRB number, and /or study name, and   Your contact information.

or 1-866-xxx-xxxx (toll free). 2. urgent clinically actionable genetic variants. this study may find that you have one or more rare genetic variants that you and your healthcare provider should know about. an example of this is a condition called malignant hyperthermia. when people with this condition get general anesthesia, their body temperature rises causing severe muscle contractions. if this happens and they irb#: page 4 of 12 version 1/2012 name and clinic number approval date: not to be used after: are not treated, they could die. this could be prevented by using a different anesthesia. experts in the center for individualized medicine will decide which genetic variants might require urgent clinical action. if any such genetic variants are found, you will be contacted and your health care provider will be informed at no cost to you. however, any costs associated with the clinical follow-up will be the responsibility of you and your insurance provider. 3. non-urgent genetic variants. through this study we may find additional genetic variants that relate to an increased risk for specific health condition. again, experts in the center for individualized medicine will identify those genetic variants for which you may be able to do something to improve your health. if any of these are found, you will be contacted and offered the option to learn these results through a free consultation with a genetic counselor. you do not have to receive this information. it will be your choice. you and/or your insurance provider will be responsible for any costs associated with clinical follow-up related to this genetic information. in the future, we also may: occasionally ask you to complete additional questionnaires or be interviewed. you may decide at that time if you want to take part. you can always say no. offer you the option to participate in other studies. you can always say no. ask you for additional blood samples. reasons for a new sample might include having used up the first sample you provided or to run new tests. you can always say no. 4. how long will you be in this research study there is no specific end date for this study. this study will build resources at mayo clinic to incorporate genetic information into clinical care. therefore there is no intention to end the study. you are agreeing to be part of ongoing research surrounding drug related genetic information at mayo clinic. at some point in time, the mayo clinic pharmacy and therapeutics committee may determine that use of specific genetic variants related to prescription drugs is irb#: page 5 of 12 version 1/2012 name and clinic number approval date: not to be used after: part of regular clinical care. at that time, your genetic information may no longer be considered part of research, but instead, part of clinical care. 5. what are the possible risks or discomforts from being in this research study blood draw risks: the risks of drawing blood include pain, bruising, lightheadedness, and fainting. infection at the site of the needle stick is a rare side effect. these are the same risks you face any time you have a blood test. confidentiality risk: as with all research, there is a chance that the confidentiality of your medical information could be compromised; however, we take precautions to decrease this risk. genetic testing: the risks of learning genetic test results may include emotional upset or insurance or job discrimination. a federal law, called the genetic information nondiscrimination act (gina), makes it illegal for health insurance companies, group health plans, and most employers to discriminate against you based on your genetic information. this law will protect you in the following ways: health insurance companies and group health plans may not request your genetic information that we get from this research. health insurance companies and group health plans may not use your genetic information when making decisions regarding your eligibility or premiums. employers with 15 or more employees may not use your genetic information when making a decision to hire, promote, or fire you or when setting the terms of your employment. all health insurance companies and group health plans must follow this law. be aware that this new federal law doesn t protect you against genetic discrimination by companies that sell life insurance, disability insurance, or long-term care insurance. members of the us military may not have the same protections under this law. more information about gina can be found at www.ginahelp.org or you can ask a member of the research team to give you additional details about gina. irb#: page 6 of 12 version 1/2012 name and clinic number approval date: not to be used after: 6. what are the possible benefits from being in this research study this study may not make your health better. the information provided by this research project, may help your health care provider make better prescription drug choices for you. this may help you avoid some prescription drug-related side effects or complications. 7. what if you want to leave this research study if you choose to withdraw from this study before your genetic information has been added to your medical record: no genetic information from this study will be added to your record, and you will not be contacted again to provide new information or asked to participate in additional studies related to this project. if you withdraw after some of your genetic information has been added to your medical record: your blood sample will be destroyed and no new genetic information will be added to your medical record; the genetic information from this study already in your medical record cannot legally be deleted (it will be permanent). however, the interpretation of your genetic information will only be updated as needed to ensure that your healthcare provider has the most accurate and up-to-date information possible; you will not be contacted again to provide new information or participate in additional studies related to this project. if you want to withdraw, contact the center for individualized medicine patient information line at 507-xxx-xxxx, or toll-free at 1-xxx-xxx-xxxx or write to the following address and tell us you wish to withdraw from the study. center for individualized medicine

8. will you be paid for taking part in this research study no, you will not be paid for taking part in this study. 9. what tests or procedures will you need to pay for if you take part in this study you won t need to pay the following; blood draw genetic tests consultation with genetic counselor however, you and/or your insurance will need to pay for all other tests and procedures that you would have as part of your clinical care, including co-payments and deductibles. this includes any follow-up procedures related to your genetic results that may be recommended by your clinician or genetic counselor. if you decide to follow up, any further medical testing will be considered part of your clinical care, and will not be paid for by the research study. 10. who is funding the study this study is funded by national human genome research institute of the national institutes of health, mayo clinic center for individualized medicine and mayo clinic center for the science of health care delivery. 11. what will happen to your blood samples and information we will keep your blood sample for future research and possibly at other institutions. if you do not want your blood sample to be used for future research, you should not take part in this study. irb#: page 8 of 12 version 1/2012 name and clinic number approval date: not to be used after: medical and genetic information it is helpful for researchers to share information they get from studying human samples. they do this by putting it into one or more scientific databases. the information is stored along with information from other studies. researchers can then study the shared information to learn even more about health and disease. if you agree to take part in this study, some of your genetic and health information may be placed into one or more national scientific databases, such as dbgap. your name and other information that could directly identify you (such as address or social security number) will never be placed into a scientific database. because your genetic information is unique to you, there is a small chance that someone could trace it back to you. the risk of this happening is very small, but may grow in the future. researchers will always have a duty to protect your privacy and to keep your information confidential. there is a very small chance that some commercial value may result from the use of your donated sample or information. if that happens, you won t be offered a share in any profits. 12. how will your privacy and the confidentiality be protected mayo clinic is committed to protecting the confidentiality of information obtained about you in connection with this research study. all of the written documents you provide will be stored in locked cabinets or scanned into password protected computer files. the information entered into your medical record will also be held to the high standards of confidentiality at mayo clinic. your blood sample will be identified only by a code number. during this research, information about your health will be collected. under federal law called the privacy rule, health information is private. however, there are exceptions to this rule, and you should know who may be able to see, use and share your health information for research and why they may need to do so. information about you and your health cannot be used in this

2019-05-13,../data//informed-consent-somatic-cell,../data//informed-consent-somatic-cell.txt,"﻿UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, IRVINE CONSENT FOR DONATION OF SOMATIC CELLS FOR HUMAN STEM CELL RESEARCH  Title of Study--required  Headings with (*) are required for all studies  IMPORTANT: BEFORE FINALIZING & PRINTING THIS DOCUMENT REMOVE THIS TEXT & ALL RED AND BLUE INSTRUCTIONAL TEXT  You are being asked to participate in a research study involving the donation of somatic cells. Somatic cells make up most of the body's tissues and organs such as the blood, brain, liver, or skin. Participation in this study is completely voluntary.  Please read the information below and ask questions about anything that you do not understand before deciding if you want to participate.  A researcher listed below will be available to answer your questions.  RESEARCH TEAM AND SPONSORS  Lead Researcher: Name and Title  Department Telephone Number: 24 Hour Telephone number:  (Required for medical studies and clinical investigations)  Other Researchers: (List only those researchers qualified to be involved in the informed consent process)  Study Location(s):        Study Sponsor(s):         The following definitions may help you understand the purpose of this study: (Keep all of the definitions that apply to this study.  Add others study design elements as necessary to aid understanding.) * Cell Line: A group of cells that can live and divide outside of the body; these cells can be frozen for storage for an indefinite period of time and can be used for future research. * Somatic Cells:  Any cell in the body except gametes (eggs or sperm). Skin cells and blood cells are types of somatic cells.   PURPOSE OF STUDY*	 The purpose of this research is to develop human stem cell lines from the somatic cells you have provided. Human stem cells have the unique combination of capacities to divide with no known limit and to develop into most of the different types of cells of the body. These stem cell lines will be used for basic science experimentation and may be used at some future time for human transplantation research. If appropriate add:  The donated somatic cells can be genetically manipulated so that they behave like stem cells. The cells after genetic manipulation are called ""induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells"".   The stem cells lines that are developed will be used to study... (Complete this sentence and include an explanation of what cells are being used and why. Examples include ""to develop a stem cell line that will allow researchers to study Huntington's disease in a human model system, and provide a cell model to screen new drugs for treatment.""     SUBJECTS* Inclusion Requirements You are eligible to participate in this study if you... (Complete this sentence or use a bulleted list of inclusion criteria) Examples include, ""are at least 18 years of age or older,"" ""you or a member of your family has Huntington's disease.""  Exclusion Requirements DO NOT LIST THE CONVERSE OF THE INCLUSION CRITERIA You are not eligible to participate in this study if you... (Complete this sentence or use a bulleted list of exclusion criteria) Examples include, ""you have had uncontrolled high blood pressure within the past 6 months; you smoke more than 20 cigarettes per day.""  Number of Participants and Time Commitment This study will include approximately       subjects and will involve approximately       of your time over the next       weeks/months.   PROCEDURES* The following procedures will occur: (Provide a detailed explanation of the research procedures in chronological order; include the expected duration of each procedure or each visit and the procedures to be completed at the visit. You may provide a visit schedule, chart, or calendar to assist the participant. Explain where the work will be conducted, the types of experiments that will be performed, whether new cell lines will be established, how they will be established, and how they will be used. Indicate that the cells may multiply indefinitely.)  Example language:  * We will ask for a skin sample from you. The skin sample is obtained by a process called a ""punch biopsy"". In this procedure, a small area of skin on the thigh or arm is cleaned and injected with xylocaine, a local anesthetic. When the skin is numb, a small round blade of three millimeters (one-eighth of an inch) in diameter is pressed into the skin, creating a circular cut approximately one eighth of an inch deep. This round piece of skin is then removed, pressure is applied to stop any bleeding and the resulting hole in the skin is covered with a sterile bandage. In some cases one or two stitches are required. The biopsy takes about ten minutes to perform, including time for cleaning and preparation. We will only ask for one punch biopsy.  If samples will be sent out of UCI for analysis or other purposes, include the statement: Your samples will be sent outside of UCI for... (Provide an explanation of where the sample will be sent and why).  Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS) research should additionally include information about Genetic Reprogramming. Individuals must initial and date their consent to use their somatic cells for iPS or other methods of genetic reprogramming. Example language:  Genetic Reprogramming (e.g. induced Pluripotent Stem Cells or iPS) is when certain genes are put into your somatic cells to study how the cells can be changed, or reprogrammed, into embryonic-like cells.  Stem cell lines may be made from the method described above. Cells multiply by dividing in two, and the genetic material is replicated every time a cell divides. It is possible that these lines, which can live indefinitely, may contain all or part of your DNA.  Any cell lines created may be kept for many years and may be used in further studies, by researchers at UCI or other research institutions outside of UCI, which cannot be predicted at the present time. They may include research that involves genetic manipulation.  It is possible that derived cells or cell products may be placed into humans or animals. There are no restrictions on the ultimate recipients of these derived cells or cell products.  _________ Initials __________ Date I consent to donate my somatic cells to 	I consent to donate my somatic cells to be used for Genetic Reprogramming (which may result in the production of stem cell lines).

OTHER CONSIDERATIONS Genetics [REQUIRED - if the study involves genetic testing or access to genetic information] As part of the study, the researcher may do genetic testing or access genetic information. Genetic research is research that studies genes, including gene characteristics and gene versions that are transmitted by parents to children. Genetic research may also include genetically modifying cells that are derived from your tissues to better understand how genes function.  Genetic research may include looking at information, such as personal appearance and biochemistry, gene sequences, genetic landmarks, individual and family medical histories, reactions to medications, and responses to treatment.   [Standard Template] A Federal law, called the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) generally makes it illegal for health insurance companies, group health plans, and employers of 15 or more persons to discriminate against you based on your genetic information. This means that they may not use your genetic information when making decisions regarding insurability. GINA does not, however, protect you against genetic discrimination by companies that sell life insurance, disability insurance, or long-term care insurance.  If you would like more information about GINA go to: http://www.genome.gov/Pages/PolicyEthics/GeneticDiscrimination/GINAInfoDoc.pdf.  [Alternative Template for research that involves individuals who have a diagnosis and/or are being treated for a genetic disease or disorder] A Federal law, called the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) generally makes it illegal for health insurance companies, group health plans, and employers of 15 or more persons to discriminate against individuals based on their genetic information. This means that they may not use genetic information when making decisions regarding insurability. GINA does not prohibit discrimination on the basis of an already manifest genetic disease or disorder.  This means if you have a diagnosis and/or are being treated for a genetic condition, a health insurer may use the information to determine eligibility or rates.  Also, GINA does not protect you against genetic discrimination by companies that sell life insurance, disability insurance, or long-term care insurance.  If you would like more information about GINA go to: http://www.genome.gov/Pages/PolicyEthics/Genetic Discrimination/GINAInfoDoc.pdf.    Use of Specimens All of the [indicate cell type and/or tissue] obtained for the purposes described in this consent form will become the property of the University of California, Irvine (UCI).  After 30 days the donation is irrevocable. These materials will be used for research and such use may result in inventions or discoveries that could become the basis for new products or diagnostic or therapeutic agents.  In some instances, these inventions and discoveries may be of potential commercial value and may be patented and licensed by the University.  You will not receive any money or other benefits derived from any commercial or other products that may be developed from use of the donated materials.     FUTURE RESEARCH Your tissue, cells or other materials derived from these tissues may be used by other researchers at UCI or by researchers at institutions outside of UCI in future studies, which are currently undefined. They may include research that involves genetic manipulation. However, the tissue, cells or other materials will not contain any identifiable information about you (for example it will not include your name, social security or medical record number).   It is possible that derived cells or cell products may be placed into humans or animals. There can be no restrictions placed on the ultimate recipients of these derived cells or cell products, except in the case where the donation is intended for autologous transplantation (where you, the donor, would also be the recipient).  The results of the study of your samples will be used for research purposes and tissue derivatives may also be used in human therapies.  You must be given the opportunity to impose restrictions on future uses of donated materials. However, researchers may choose to use materials only from donors who agree to all future uses without restrictions.   I consent to my samples [name cell type and/or tissue] be saved for future research.  	 No restrictions. 	 Restrictions (please specify): ________________________________________   I do not consent to my samples being saved for future research that is currently undefined.

2019-05-13,../data//assent,../data//assent.txt,"    NIGMS HUMAN GENETIC CELL REPOSITORY    ASSENT FORM  What is Assent?  Assent is the process of obtaining authorization to collect a specimen from individuals who are not able  to give consent for themselves. Legally authorized representatives must provide consent for children  and cognitively impaired subjects to donate a sample, but the investigator/submitter must attempt to  obtain assent from the subject if it is possible. Children aged 7 through 17 can give authorizations by  signing this assent document.  This form is to be used in addition to the NIGMS Human Genetic Cell  Repository Informed Consent Form (Form 1401-63).  What is the NIGMS Human Genetic Cell Repository?  The NIGMS Repository is a biobank. A biobank is a collection of samples from people’s bodies that are  stored in a safe place. Cells from people with inherited diseases are stored in the NIGMS Repository. We  are trying to help researchers find out about the causes of diseases that run in families. Scientists want  to find the causes of disease so they can help doctors to cure the disease or even stop it from happening  in the first place.  What will happen if I participate?  If you want to donate a sample, this is what will happen. We will take a small amount of blood from your  arm or a small piece of skin from the inside of your arm. This sample will be used to make more samples  that can be given to the scientists to study.  There are some parts of the study that might hurt or upset you when the blood or skin is taken, but we  will make it as comfortable as possible for you. You might feel a pinching or burning for a few minutes or  there may be a little bleeding that needs a BandAid.  Do I have to participate?  You can decide yourself if you want to donate a sample. We do not know if donating a sample will help  you, but someday we may learn something that will help other people.  You do not have to donate a  sample. It is up to you. You will still be taken care of even if you decide that you do not want to be in the  study.  If you want to donate a sample, please sign or print your name.

About volunteering for this research study  You/your surviving child is/are being invited to take part in a research study. Your/your surviving child’s participation is voluntary which means you/your surviving child can choose whether or  not you/your surviving child want(s) to take part in this study. People who agree to take part in research studies are cal ed “subjects” or “research subjects”. These words are used throughout  this consent form. Before you/your surviving child can make your/his/her decision, you/he/she  will need to know what the study is about, the possible risks and benefits of being in this study, and what you/he/she will have to do in this study. You/your surviving child may also decide to  discuss this study and this form with your family, friends, or doctor. If you/your surviving child have/has any questions about the study or about this form, please ask us. If you/your child  decides to take part in this study, you must sign this form. We will give you/your surviving child a copy of this form signed by you for you/your surviving child to keep.      2.  What is the purpose of this study?  The purpose of this part of the SUDC Registry and Research Collaborative is to study  biospecimens (blood and saliva) of biological family members who lost a relative to Sudden  Unexplained Death in Childhood (SUDC) in order to understand the risks that lead to SUDC, to  help us understand these deaths, and to identify at-risk individuals. In addition, we hope to gain 1	 of	 12    Approved For Period: 9/13/2016 - 9/12/2017  	 Study #: S14-01061  Version date: 12/21/2015    knowledge to establish prevention strategies to reduce chances of SUDC in the future. You/your  surviving child are/is being asked to participate by donating blood and/or saliva for testing  because you/your surviving child are/is a family member of a child who died unexpectedly  without clear explanation.      3.  How long will I/my child be in the study? How many other people will  be in the study?  We estimate that the following number of subjects will enroll in this study.  At this site: 400 SUDC children; 800 Biological parents and 100 symptomatic siblings and/or  second degree relatives. Total at all sites: 1300 participants  Your/your child’s participation may involve 1 office visit if a blood draw at the NYU Epilepsy  Center is necessary. If not, then it will not involve any office visits.      4.  What will I/my child be asked to do in the study?  If you/your surviving child chooses to take part in the study, we will ask you to sign this consent form before you/your surviving child have/has any procedures with the study staff that are part  of the study.  You/your surviving child will be asked to come to the NYU Epilepsy Center or visit a local  laboratory for a blood draw or if a blood sample is not available, we will take a saliva sample.  For saliva samples we will use a buccal swab. This is very similar to a cotton swab or also  known as q-tip. We will swipe the inside of the mouth once with this swab and it will not hurt at all. If you/your child do/does not want to visit NYU Epilepsy Center or a local laboratory, we can also arrange your/your child’s blood draw through a private phlebotomy (blood drawing)  service, such as Examination Management Services, Inc (EMSI). The EMSI will have a contract  in place with NYU and it will cost you nothing to have this done. The EMSI will then send us  these samples where we will de-identify them and send them to Columbia University for genetic  testing. If any samples are left over they will be destroyed at the end of the study.  You/your surviving child will have 8.5 mL (which is equivalent to 0.5 of a tablespoon) of blood  drawn for DNA testing. DNA is the makeup of a person’s genes. Genes determine things about  a person like hair and eye color, but may also indicate risk for disease or how a person might  respond to treatment. Your/your surviving child’s DNA is being tested to look for genetics of  SUDC.  Your/your surviving child’s blood will be sent to Columbia University for testing. Your/your  surviving child’s blood sample will be coded with a unique, de-identified number so that you/your 2 	 of	 12  Approved For Period: 9/13/2016 - 9/12/2017    	 Study #: S14-01061  Version date: 12/21/2015    surviving child cannot be identified by your/your surviving child’s sample. No names, birthdates, or any type of identifiable information will be written on the sample.  Any leftover samples will be banked and stored at the NYU Biorepository until the study comes  to a close. Then all samples will be destroyed. Samples will only be identifiable to the NYU  SUDC research team who will maintain the link between you/your surviving child and  your/his/her sample.  Genetic testing results will be kept on workstations situated within the NYU Comprehensive  Epilepsy Center. Only registered researchers will have access to the data. The workstations are  protected by the NYUMC “firewal ” to prevent outside attacks. Your/your child’s confidentiality  will be honored and no data that can be identified with you will be released to anyone that isn’t connected to this research project without your permission.  Genetic Testing: By donating blood or saliva to a study in which we are going to try to discover more about the genetic risks of SUDC, you/your surviving child may be concerned about  receiving or not receiving genetic results. It is optional to receive the genetic results to this study. You/your surviving child may choose whether or not you/he/she wish(es) to learn that a  specific gene defect has been found in your/your surviving child’s family. In our study, this  information will be shared separately to each subject upon receiving results.  SUDC Genetic Report      Checking this box indicates I DO want to receive the genetic analysis report that may be  generated from this study from my/my surviving child’s blood and/or saliva that may benefit  me/my surviving child (or family members) in relation to choices regarding preventative or  clinical care.      Signature of Family Member Subject  Date      Checking this box indicates I DO NOT want to receive the genetic analysis reports that may  be generated from this study from my/my surviving child’s blood and/or saliva even if results  may be important to my/my surviving child’s health or family’s health.      Signature of Family Member Subject  Date      3 of	 12  Approved For Period: 9/13/2016 - 9/12/2017    	 Study #: S14-01061  Version date: 12/21/2015    If at any time during or after the study you change your mind about whether or not you would  like to be notified, you can contact us at the contact information listed on the first page of this consent form.  After a report is generated and given to you, we will have SUDC Foundation or SUDCRRC  mental health professionals follow-up with a phone cal to ensure you aren’t suffering  emotionally due to the report.  Incidental or Unrelated Genetic Findings: It is possible that this genetic study will identify information about your child that was previously unknown, such as disease status or risk. The  American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) defines an incidental/unrelated  finding as an abnormality that is discovered through a deliberate search for disease-causing or  likely disease-causing genetic changes that are not relevant to the reason for testing and may  not be included in genes of interest relative to the SUDCRRC. We will look at a specific set of genes as currently recommended by ACMG; variants in these genes are known to be associated  with human disease, and incidental/unrelated findings would have medical benefit for  the patients and families of patients. These genes include some cancer or tumor syndromes,  some connective tissue diseases, cardiomyopathies, and arrhythmias. Some of these  conditions have onset in adulthood and an individual may not have recognizable features now.  These disorders were selected because there may be changes in medical management for an  individual if the individual is known to have a genetic susceptibility to one or more of these  disorders. A complete list of diseases/disorders tested for is included in the Summary of  Informed Consent Form, which you will be given.  Subjects may choose to be provided information on known, disease-causing genetic changes in  these ACMG-specified genes as well as genetic changes that may be disease-causing. If a  genetic change is identified in one of these ACMG-specified genes, further testing for that  specific gene may be recommended. The absence of a reportable finding in these genes does  not mean that an individual has no disease-causing changes in these genes. Coverage of these  genes through whole exome sequencing may not be as comprehensive as in panels designed  to investigate them.  It is possible that we may identify a genetic variant in a gene that is not included on the ACMG  gene list. Most often we will not know with much certainty whether such variants have health  implications. Rarely, we may believe the variant is of urgent medical importance; if that is the case, you will be informed of this information, regardless of your choice below. If an  incidental/unrelated result is found, we will attempt to notify you using the contact information you have provided, so that you can speak with Dr. Orrin Devinsky, Dr. Jennifer Lau and/or a  genetic counselor referral convenient to you.      4 of	 12  Approved For Period: 9/13/2016 - 9/12/2017    	 Study #: S14-01061  Version date: 12/21/2015    Please initial below whether or not you would like to be notified of incidental/unrelated findings in the ACMG-specified genes identified in this research study:      Please notify me of any incidental/unrelated findings in the ACMG-specified genes  obtained from this research from me/my surviving child.      Please do NOT notify me of any incidental/unrelated findings in the ACMG-specified  genes obtained from this research from me/my surviving child.      Please ask me if/when incidental/unrelated findings in the ACMG-specified genes are  identified whether or not I want to receive this information from me/my surviving child.      5.  What are the possible risks or discomforts?  The following are risks and discomforts that you/your child may experience during your/his/her  participation in this research study. Participation in this study poses no more than minimal risk.  During the blood draw, you/your child may experience some discomfort, bruising, or momentary  pain at the site of needle entry into the vein, as you/your child might experience during any blood draw. There is a remote risk of fainting. Infection could occur at the place where the needle goes into the arm. However, we will take all available precautions to prevent an infection using sterile technique. There are potential psychological risks that maybe associated with being approached  about this study. These include but are not limited to: survivor stress and guilt under  circumstances where the cause of death was determined to have been preventable, survivor  disappointment resulting from the lack of identifying a cause of death despite the research  review done during this study, and reactivation of painful emotions surrounding your child’s  death.  Genetic testing can generate information about subjects’ personal health risks and can cause or  increase anxiety, damage family relationships, and/or compromise insurability, employability and can even lead to discrimination. In order to protect against loss of confidentiality, sensitive  information will be kept in locked file cabinets and in secured databases. The test results will not be released to insurance companies or any other third parties.  There is a chance that a mutation (an alteration of the DNA) in a gene may be identified.  Obtaining genetic information about yourself /your child or your/his/her family members may  provoke anxiety and confusion and damage familial relationships. Sharing genetic information  may compromise your/his/her insurability and employment opportunities.      5 of	 12  Approved For Period: 9/13/2016 - 9/12/2017    	 Study #: S14-01061  Version date: 12/21/2015    If the genetic analysis finds anything clinical y relevant related to your child’s death, the  investigators will have the results confirmed by a CLIA-certified genetic laboratory. If such a mutation is detected in your DNA, you/your surviving child would be contacted and a genetic  counseling appointment would be arranged with Dr. Heather Lau, a neurogeneticist, which is a  doctor that specializes in the study of genetics of the brain will be able to give information and referrals to geneticists (a doctor that specializes in the study of genes) in your/your child’s area.  During this appointment, the relevant results and their implications would be discussed with  you/your child. You/your child may choose not to be contacted with information on study results.  In addition, the decision whether or not to report this information to your/your child’s healthcare providers would be up to you. The research results will never go into your medical record or be  shared with anyone.  Your/your child’s name and identifiers will not be mentioned in publications or reports; thereby greatly reducing the possibility of psychological or social risks that could arise from knowledge of this genetic information, such as risk for your employability or insurability or the risk of  discrimination.  There are no risks to your/your child’s health or possibility of physical discomfort involved in allowing your/his/her samples to be stored in a bank, because your/your child’s excess samples  will otherwise be discarded. Although health information that is col ected from your/your child’s genetic reporting will be kept in a secure database, there is always the risk that it may be  accessed by individuals not associated with this study. Efforts will be made to protect your  confidentiality as described in this form.      6.  What if new information becomes available?  During the course of this study we may find more information that could be important to you/your child. This includes information that might cause you/your child to change your/his/her mind  about being in the study. We will notify you/your child as soon as possible if such information  becomes available.      7.  What are the possible benefits of the study?  There is no direct benefit to you/your child expected from your participation in this study. It is hoped that the knowledge gained will be of benefit to others in the future in the understanding of SUDC and may help in developing prevention strategies. There is also the potential benefit  from receiving genetic reports for families as they may uncover clinical y relevant mutations that were not tested for as part of the standard autopsy and offer appropriate testing of at risk family members. The opportunity for genetic testing to provide negative results may also assist in  decreasing some anxiety as well.      6 of	 12  Approved For Period: 9/13/2016 - 9/12/2017    	 Study #: S14-01061  Version date: 12/21/2015    8.  What other choices do I have if I/my child do/does not participate?  The alternative option is not to participate in this study.      9.  Will I/my child be paid for being in this study?  You/your child will not be compensated for participation in this study.      10. Will I have to pay for anything?  All study-related costs associated with your participation will be paid by NYU FACES. This study is being sponsored by FACES (Finding a Cure for Epilepsy and Seizures) a non-profit  organization.  NYU School of Medicine maintains a financial disclosure process, by which people who conduct  research must disclose any financial investments (for example, stock shares or patent holdings), board and management positions, or payments (for example, for consulting or speaking  engagements) that are related to the research. Persons involved in this research study have told us of an outside interest that may affect this research study.  Dr. Orrin Devinsky, the principal investigator of this study, and Ms. Laura Crandall, a research study team member, each are board members of the SUDC Foundation. Ms. Crandall serves as  the SUDC Foundation Executive Director and receives travel reimbursements of less than  $5,000.  The NYU School of Medicine’s Conflicts of Interest Management Unit has reviewed the potential  conflict of interest arising from the researchers’ board positions and Ms. Crandall’s executive  director position and receipt of travel reimbursements. After the review, they determined that  these relationships and the receipt of payments is a potential conflict of interest and placed  restrictions on the researchers’ participation in the research study, including that you be  informed before you enroll in this study. They further concluded that there is little increased risk to your health or to the scientific quality of the research study because of the receipt of  payments. If you would like more information, please ask the researchers, the study coordinator  or the Conflicts of Interest Management Unit at 212-263-4489.      11.

The principal investigator’s name and phone number are listed at the top of page 1 of this consent form.  There are resources available to you if you feel upset as a result of participating in this study.  Dr. Orrin Devinsky and Laura Crandall will be readily available if you have any concerns  regarding the study. We also have Dr. Scott Hirsch, our in-house neuropsychiatrist and Dr.  William MacAllister, a neuropsychologist, will both be available to speak to if you are under  emotional stress due to this study. In addition, there are support services we would be able to  help point you to the proper support group, if necessary.  There are no plans for the NYU School of Medicine or Medical Center to pay you/your child or  give you/your child other compensation for the injury. You/your child do/does not give up  your/his/her legal rights by signing this form.      12. When is the study over? Can I/my child leave the Study before it ends?  This study is expected to end after all participants have completed all visits, and all information has been col ected. This study may also be stopped or your participation ended at any time by  Dr. Orrin Devinsky, the Principal Investigator, without your consent because:  ● The principal investigator feels it is necessary for your health or safety. Such an action  would not require your consent, but you will be informed if such a decision is made and  the reason for this decision.  ● You have not followed study instructions.  If you/your child decide(s) to take part in this study, you/he/she may withdraw from participation at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which you/he/she would otherwise be entitled.  You/your child may withdraw your consent for the research use of specimen and revoke  your/his/her Authorization for the use and disclosure of your/his/her protected health information at any time and without penalty.

The nature of the test and how it will be performed.   --What is Whole Exome Sequencing (WES)?   Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) is a new type of genetic test. WES searches through the most important  part of a person’s entire genetic material, called the “exome”, for DNA variation that can cause disease.  Instructions  in the exome tell our cells how to make the right components to function properly.  Abnormalities of this information  can lead to disease. Because WES examines a larger portion of the genetic material than traditional tests, it might  discover the cause of disease in cases where other tests did not. WES may also reveal information about unexpected  diseases. Because WES is more complicated than other genetic tests, the consent and ordering process must be  thorough and will be done with the assistance of a genetic counselor and/or your doctor.   How is the test done?    Two tubes (two teaspoons) of blood will be collected from you.  Based on your family tree, your genetic  counselor or doctor may also recommend that blood be drawn from two or more members of your family, such as  your parents or siblings, to help with interpretation of test results.  The exome is part of the DNA sequence. DNA from  your blood is purified, then the exome sequence is obtained (or “read”) using WES. The exome sequence is then  searched for changes that might cause disease.   How is this test interpreted?   Once the exome is read, the information obtained is analyzed for differences between your exome sequence  and a reference (“normal) sequence. Everyone has places in their exome that differ from the reference. These  differences make us unique and usually do not cause medical problems.  To determine whether the changes that are  found are neutral, or can cause disease, the following steps are taken:  First, the variations in your exome will be compared with a list of mutations that are known to cause medical  problems in other people with symptoms similar to yours. Subsequently one will examine whether disruptive  mutations not previously described are present in genes that are known to cause the type of disease you have.  Changes found will be compared to the changes seen in your selected family members with or without the disease (if  available) to confirm that the changes are indeed the cause of your disease.   2. The Primary Purpose of the test (why it is being performed).   The test is being performed to detect one (or more than one) genetic causes for your condition. The condition is   _____________________, which causes _______________________________________.    The test results may be complex, so you must obtain genetic counseling before signing  this consent.  3. What kinds of results may be obtained, what is their significance for health, and what  should you do after receiving the results?    What kind of results may be reported?  There are several different kinds of results that may be reported. All results will go directly to your doctor or  your other healthcare provider who ordered the test.    th Personalized Genomic Medicine Laboratory  630 West 168  Street  Department of Pathology and Cell Biology  P&S17-401  www.pathology.columbia.edu  New York, NY 10032    Tel: 212-305-9706  OFFICE USE    Fax: 212-342-0420   ONLY:   WES sequencing reviewed:  Lab Acc. #:__________      1. Positive for disease-causing mutation(s): You may have one or more genetic variation(s) that are known  to cause a specific genetic condition in other individuals with similar symptoms. The variant or variants  would then be called a mutation or mutations and would be interpreted as the cause of your symptoms.  2. No disease causing mutation(s) found: It is possible that the test will not find any genetic change that  could explain your symptoms.  This type of test result does not mean your condition is not genetic. The  result would not take away whatever current diagnoses doctors may have given for your condition.   3. Variant with uncertain significance: Sometimes the test will find a variation that is predicted to be  important, but has not been reported or seen before in people with your condition.  Such a variant may or  may not be the cause of your symptoms. The lab would report it as a “variant with uncertain significance”  if there is evidence strongly suggesting that it is related to your condition.  4. “Incidental findings”: These are test results that are not related to the symptoms for which the test was  ordered. They might indicate that you have another previously undiagnosed, potentially serious condition.   Some of these diseases might manifest later during your lifetime and knowing about them might help to  prevent development of serious medical conditions. A list of such conditions is provided below.  You may  decide whether or not you want to be alerted to the presence of these conditions.      Cancer predisposition syndromes  Conditions Genes  Li-Fraumeni syndrome (many cancers) P53  Lynch syndrome (Hereditary non-polyposis MSH2, MLH1, MSH6, (PMS2)  colon cancer) (colon, endometrial, and other  cancers).  Gardner Syndrome (Familial adenomatous APC  polyposis) (colon and other cancers)  Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome (kidney, brain VHL  and other cancers)  Multiple endocrine neoplasia type2A (thyroid RET  and other cancers)  Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome  (many PTEN  cancers)  Retinoblastoma (cancer of the eye in children) RB1    Life threatening conditions  Conditions Genes  Long QT syndrome (irregular heartbeat that KCNQ1, KCNE1, KCNE2, KCNH2, KCNJ2,  can be fatal) ANK2, CAV3  Malignant hyperthermia (sensitivity to certain RYR1  medications)  Brugada syndrome (irregular heartbeat) SCN5A (GPD1L, CACNA1C, CACNA1C,  CACNB2, SCN1B, KCNE3, SCN3B, HCN4)  Other heart conditions: Marfan syndrome,   hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,  hemochromatosis,  Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular RYR2, CASQ2  tachycardia (irregular heartbeat)      th Personalized Genomic Medicine Laboratory  630 West 168  Street  Department of Pathology and Cell Biology  P&S17-401  www.pathology.columbia.edu  New York, NY 10032    Tel: 212-305-9706  OFFICE USE    Fax: 212-342-0420   ONLY:   WES sequencing reviewed:  Lab Acc. #:__________    May I choose whether or not I am provided with the incidental findings?  Yes, this is your choice.    Please state whether you want to be informed about incidental findings causing the conditions listed above.  ___(Initial) I would like to learn of incidental findings related to the conditions listed.  ___(Initial) I would NOT like to learn of incidental findings related to the conditions listed.    Are there any types of results that will not be given to me?  Yes, there are a few types of results that will not be included in the report your doctor gets.   1. Some changes in genes might make a person slightly more likely to develop a type of common condition  that happens in adults, such as diabetes or heart disease.  Because these changes are not well  understood, they are not looked at in detail or included in the report.  2. Some changes in genes might make a person much more likely to develop a type of condition that  happens in adults, such as Alzheimer’s disease.  However, these changes do not guarantee that the  condition will develop in a given individual, and even though the increased risk is known, no action can  be taken to modify it.    3. We might use your relatives’ samples to help us diagnose your condition, but we will not report results for  these individuals. However, your genetic results might have implications for your relatives. It is important  that you discuss these implications with your genetic counselor.  4. You might be carrying a mutation that could have effects on your children, if your partner carries a similar  mutation.  This is called “carrier” status.  We will not report your carrier status for any disease.  If you are  concerned about carrier status for conditions that might run in your family, you should get tested  separately for carrier status. You should discuss these implications with your genetic counselor.  5. A few genes are patented outside of Columbia University, so we may not be able to legally report results  from those genes.  What should I do if there is a positive result?               This is a test to identify a genetic cause of your clinical condition. If the test is positive for a genetic cause of  your clinical condition or for another mutation that you requested to be informed about, you may wish to consult your  physician or have further genetic counseling or undergo further independent testing.  ____ (Initial) I understand that I have the option to seek further independent testing, and that I should obtain genetic  counseling to help me understand the results.   Are there limitations to the testing?  Yes, there are several limitations to WES:  1. At the current time, the test may not reveal 100% of the exome. Therefore, there is a possibility that there    th Personalized Genomic Medicine Laboratory  630 West 168  Street  Department of Pathology and Cell Biology  P&S17-401  www.pathology.columbia.edu  New York, NY 10032    Tel: 212-305-9706  OFFICE USE    Fax: 212-342-0420   ONLY:   WES sequencing reviewed:  Lab Acc. #:__________       could be a mutation or variation that is causing your condition that is not picked up by the WES test.  2. The WES report is generated based on current medical knowledge. A mutation that is not known to be  the cause of a genetic condition today may be shown to be disease-causing in a year or two.  We do not  generate updated reports for the test, unless we are requested to do so by the patient. There is a fee  associated with providing an updated report.    3. WES is not currently validated to detect large-scale alterations in the DNA content of the patient’s cells.   These include losses or duplications of many genes.  Another genetic test called “microarray” is available  for this purpose.  A microarray test might be ordered by your physician before the WES testing.  4. WES may not be able to detect genetic disorders that are caused by expansion of repetitive regions of  the genome. One example is Fragile X syndrome.  If one of these conditions is suspected, your physician  should order the appropriate test.  5. WES is not able to detect mutations in the 99% of the DNA that is not part of the exome, including parts  of the DNA that help regulate gene function.   6. WES may detect findings of uncertain significance, which cannot be proven with complete certainty to be  the cause of your condition (see types of results described above).  7. Finding a disease-causing mutation may not result in a treatment, cure, or a prognosis (knowledge about  how a disease is expected to progress).   8. Standard lab limitations caused by human error, such as sample contamination or sample mix-up, may  occur but are unlikely.  ____ (Initial) I understand the limitations to WES  4. When DNA testing detects the most common disease-causing changes in a gene, the  test result is highly accurate.    5. Implications of positive and negative results for your diagnosis  Predicting the results of the WES in advance is not possible. Predicting in advance what the results will mean for your  health is also not possible. This is due to the fact that many genes are tested and many different positive results can  be obtained. Each of these different results will have potentially different implications.  A negative result (not finding  variants) will not change your clinical diagnosis.      6. Who will have access to the results?               The results of the WES will become a part of your medical record. Test results are stored in the laboratory’s  computer records, and are normally automatically sent to computerized medical records of New York Presbyterian  Hospital and Columbia University. If you do not want these results to be sent to these records, you must inform us  about this. Unless you tell us not to transmit them, the results will become part of your electronic medical record.  Even if they do not become part of the electronic medical record, the results may be made available to  individuals/organizations with legal access to your medical record, on a strict “need-to-know” basis. Those with legal  access include, but are not limited to, the physicians and nursing staff directly involved in your care, your current and  future insurance carriers, and others specifically authorized by the you or your authorized representative.  ____ __(Initial) I understand, that the results will be automatically transmitted to my electronic medical records in the  NYPH and Columbia University EMRs. I do not object to this.   ______ (Initial): Please do not transmit any of the “incidental” findings to the hospital or university electronic medical     th Personalized Genomic Medicine Laboratory  630 West 168  Street  Department of Pathology and Cell Biology  P&S17-401  www.pathology.columbia.edu  New York, NY 10032    Tel: 212-305-9706  OFFICE USE    Fax: 212-342-0420   ONLY:   WES sequencing reviewed:  Lab Acc. #:__________      records. Only transmit the results related to my present condition. I understand that I must assume responsibility for  informing my future physicians about incidental findings that require intervention.   _______(Initial) Please do not transmit any of the results to the hospital or university electronic medical records. I  understand that the results will continue to be part of the laboratory’s electronic information system. If test results are  not entered into my hospital or university electronic medical records, future physicians may not have access to those  results. I understand that I must assume responsibility for informing my future physicians about findings of the WES  test that affect my healthcare.     7. How long are the WES results kept in the testing lab?  The laboratory will keep the identified WES raw data in the lab for 5 years. The final report will be kept as  long as possible, at least 5 years.  After this, the data from which the final report was generated will be de-identified,  and will be stored in a database that does not include any names or other information that would link them back to an  individual. However, information about the type of disease and the type of symptoms associated with the genetic  findings will be preserved.  Because this is a new test, it is important to keep track of the types of mutations and  variants that are being found in association with particular diseases. This helps us improve our diagnostic  capabilities. This might not directly benefit you, but it might benefit future patients with similar conditions. Please  indicate your choice below.  ____ (Initial) I agree to my WES data being stored indefinitely in a de-identified way.  ____ (Initial) I do not want my WES data being stored indefinitely, even if it is de-identified.  8. Statement that no additional tests will be performed on this sample, without specific,  signed authorization by the patient/legal representative, and that after 60 days, unless  consent is given, the sample will be destroyed.  How long are the samples kept in the lab?  Blood and DNA samples are normally discarded after 60 days following test completion, unless you provide  us consent to store the DNA after testing is performed.  Storing your sample may allow you to request testing in the  future without having to obtain a new sample, or to participate in future research, should you wish to do so.   ____ (Initial) Please keep DNA used in WES testing indefinitely for future testing should I desire such testing, or if I  want to participate in research in the future. I understand that no additional genetic tests will be performed without my  specific consent/instructions. The DNA may be used only for quality control purposes. There is no guarantee of  availability past 60 days. If I decide to participate in research in the future, I will instruct the laboratory, and there will  be a requirement of a separate IRB-approved consent).  ____ (Initial) Do not keep my DNA used in my WES testing linked to information that could identify who I am. I  consent to the use of my de-identified DNA for quality control purposes or for research in which my identity cannot be  determined.

What are the risks of testing?   1. Identification of familial relationships: WES may identify familial relationships other than those originally  reported.  For example, non-paternity (when the reported father of the child is not the biological father) or  half sibling-ships (when siblings do not share the same father AND mother) would be detected. You may  choose whether or not to be informed of this information, in case it is revealed during the testing.     2. Discrimination. The genetic non-discrimination law prevents insurance companies from using your  genetic information to deny health insurance coverage. However, the law does not cover life insurance,  disability insurance or long term care insurance. The detection of an incidental condition may affect your  future ability to buy these forms of insurance or get the best insurance rates. By New York State Law,  your consent is required for the release of these results to insurance companies. However, you may be  required to release this information to the insurance companies for your contract with them to be valid.     3. Requirement for further testing: WES may identify genetic changes that may require additional testing to  evaluate.  This could result in anxiety, uncertainty, and additional expenses that may or may not be  covered by your insurance.     4. Detection of untreatable conditions. WES may identify serious, untreatable genetic conditions. It can  result in unexpected psychological trauma, both for you and your family. The detection of such a  condition could also affect the health or health care needs of your siblings, children, or other close  relatives.         10. Statement of Financial responsibility  ____ (Initial) I understand that I, having requested testing to be performed, am responsible for the cost of this testing  and will be required to pay for any/all of the test cost if health insurance does not reimburse the laboratory. In  addition, if health insurance pays for the test, I understand that the laboratory is required to bill me for the co-pay or  coinsurance that is required by my health plan.     11.

In a  constantly updated encyclopedia of mendelian human disorders, OMIM, as of October 16,  2012, there are about 3600 phenotypes described in which the molecular basis of the  disease is known. There is also an additional 3600 phenotypes listed that have no known  molecular basis to date.  The number of genes described on the site is past 14,000, and  all these genes are thought to be relevant to human disease, although maybe only half of  them have a confirmed role in one or more genetic disorders.    The current paradigm for genetic diagnosis rests on PCR and microarray-based  detection of specific mutations of known significance and/or Sanger sequencing that  allows detection of previously described, as well as novel mutations, in genes that have  been well established to play a role in a specific disease.  These methods work well for  screening for specific mutations or for demonstration of mutations in a small number of  genes, if the gene(s) to test can be largely ascertained based on the clinical phenotype.   However, they fall short in cases where the phenotype and genotype correlation is not  strong enough to efficiently guide the decision-making process as to what mutation in  which gene should be tested for. In cases like congenital hearing loss in which over 100  loci have been implicated, it is often impossible to establish in what order to perform the  review of genes linked to the phenotype.  Even if a more logical phenotype based  approach is available, like in the case of muscular dystrophies, the diagnostic odyssey is  often too painful and expensive to undertake.  Since genetic information is changing at a  rapid pace, clinicians may be unaware of all known genes and, therefore, fail to order the  appropriate tests. NGS allows for simultaneous sequencing of large number of genes that  might carry mutations causing the symptoms of a patient at an affordable price. This  prevents individual clinician bias in testing decisions and improves diagnostic success  rate.    We offer four clinical NGS tests at the Personalized Genomic Medicine Laboratories at  Columbia University Medical Center. These are full mitochondrial genome sequencing  (MGS), the Columbia Combined Genetic Panel (CCGP), whole exome sequencing (WES)  and whole genome sequencing (WGS) tests. The MGS and CCGP tests are for patients  whose disease shows a very characteristic phenotype strongly associated with mutations  in the mitochondrial genome, or in a few dozen candidate genes. The WES and WGS  tests are to be used in situations where one cannot generate a credible list of candidate  genes to be tested. These tests interrogate all coding regions or the entire genome,  respectively. In addition to identifying known disease causing mutations and probable  disease causing mutations in disease associated genes they can also identify entirely  new private mutations in genes previously not linked to the disease.  Confirmation of the  disease causing nature of these novel mutations is based on segregation of the mutation  in families and structural and functional characteristics of the mutation and the gene itself.       th Personalized Genomic Medicine Laboratory  630 West 168  Street  Department of Pathology and Cell Biology  P&S17-401  www.pathology.columbia.edu  New York, NY 10032    Tel: 212-305-9706  OFFICE USE    Fax: 212-342-0420   ONLY:   WES sequencing reviewed:  Lab Acc. #:__________      Indication for testing   The presence of a congenital developmental abnormality of presumed genetic  origin   Development of symptoms that suggest the presence of a genetic disorder with  mitochondrial or Mendelian inheritance    Methodology   Hardware: Illumina sequencing instruments: MiSeq for MGS and CCGP tests and  HiSeq2500 for WES and WGS tests.    Capture reagents: We use PCR to capture the mitochondrial genome and Agilent  Sureselect technology to capture the regions of interest (ROI) for the CCGP and  WES studies.  The WGS does not require capture, since the entire genome is  sequenced.    Specimen requirements   All specimens should carry two independent identifiers.    Blood > 300microliters, should be anti-coagulated, preferably with citrate or EDTA  and should be less than a week old.     Muscle biopsy specimens (>50mg) should be refrigerated from the time of biopsy  to arrival to the lab.    DNA should be greater than 10kb median length. We optimally need 3 micrograms  of genomic DNA at concentrations 50-200ng/microliter.

whole exome sequencing (wes) is a new type of genetic test. wes searches through the most important part of a person s entire genetic material, called the exome , for dna variation that can cause disease. instructions in the exome tell our cells how to make the right components to function properly. abnormalities of this information can lead to disease. because wes examines a larger portion of the genetic material than traditional tests, it might discover the cause of disease in cases where other tests did not. wes may also reveal information about unexpected diseases. because wes is more complicated than other genetic tests, the consent and ordering process must be thorough and will be done with the assistance of a genetic counselor and/or your doctor. how is the test done two tubes (two teaspoons) of blood will be collected from you. based on your family tree, your genetic counselor or doctor may also recommend that blood be drawn from two or more members of your family, such as your parents or siblings, to help with interpretation of test results. the exome is part of the dna sequence. dna from your blood is purified, then the exome sequence is obtained (or read ) using wes. the exome sequence is then searched for changes that might cause disease. how is this test interpreted once the exome is read, the information obtained is analyzed for differences between your exome sequence and a reference ( normal) sequence. everyone has places in their exome that differ from the reference. these differences make us unique and usually do not cause medical problems. to determine whether the changes that are found are neutral, or can cause disease, the following steps are taken: first, the variations in your exome will be compared with a list of mutations that are known to cause medical problems in other people with symptoms similar to yours. subsequently one will examine whether disruptive mutations not previously described are present in genes that are known to cause the type of disease you have. changes found will be compared to the changes seen in your selected family members with or without the disease (if available) to confirm that the changes are indeed the cause of your disease. 2. the primary purpose of the test (why it is being performed). the test is being performed to detect one (or more than one) genetic causes for your condition. the condition is , which causes . the test results may be complex, so you must obtain genetic counseling before signing this consent. 3. what kinds of results may be obtained, what is their significance for health, and what should you do after receiving the results what kind of results may be reported there are several different kinds of results that may be reported. all results will go directly to your doctor or your other healthcare provider who ordered the test. th personalized genomic medicine laboratory 630 west 168 street department of pathology and cell biology p&s17-401 www.pathology.columbia.edu

that are known to cause a specific genetic condition in other individuals with similar symptoms. the variant or variants would then be called a mutation or mutations and would be interpreted as the cause of your symptoms. 2. no disease causing mutation(s) found: it is possible that the test will not find any genetic change that could explain your symptoms. this type of test result does not mean your condition is not genetic. the result would not take away whatever current diagnoses doctors may have given for your condition. 3. variant with uncertain significance: sometimes the test will find a variation that is predicted to be important, but has not been reported or seen before in people with your condition. such a variant may or may not be the cause of your symptoms. the lab would report it as a variant with uncertain significance if there is evidence strongly suggesting that it is related to your condition. 4. incidental findings : these are test results that are not related to the symptoms for which the test was ordered. they might indicate that you have another previously undiagnosed, potentially serious condition. some of these diseases might manifest later during your lifetime and knowing about them might help to prevent development of serious medical conditions. a list of such conditions is provided below. you may decide whether or not you want to be alerted to the presence of these conditions. cancer predisposition syndromes conditions genes li-fraumeni syndrome (many cancers) p53 lynch syndrome (hereditary non-polyposis msh2, mlh1, msh6, (pms2) colon

(initial) i would like to learn of incidental findings related to the conditions listed. (initial) i would not like to learn of incidental findings related to the conditions listed. are there any types of results that will not be given to me yes, there are a few types of results that will not be included in the report your doctor gets. 1. some changes in genes might make a person slightly more likely to develop a type of common condition that happens in adults, such as diabetes or heart disease. because these changes are not well understood, they are not looked at in detail or included in the report. 2. some changes in genes might make a person much more likely to develop a type of condition that happens in adults, such as alzheimer s disease. however, these changes do not guarantee that the condition will develop in a given individual, and even though the increased risk is known, no action can be taken to modify it. 3. we might use your relatives samples to help us diagnose your condition, but we will not report results for these individuals. however, your genetic results might have implications for your relatives. it is important that you discuss these implications with your genetic counselor. 4. you might be carrying a mutation that could have effects on your children, if your partner carries a similar mutation. this is called carrier status. we will not report your carrier status for any disease. if you are concerned about carrier status for conditions that might run in your family, you should get tested separately for carrier status. you should discuss these implications with your genetic counselor. 5. a few genes are patented outside of columbia university, so we may not be able to legally report results from those genes. what should i do if there is a positive result this is a test to identify a genetic cause of your clinical condition. if the test is positive for a genetic cause of your clinical condition or for another mutation that you requested to be informed about, you may wish to consult your physician or have further genetic counseling or undergo further independent testing.  (initial) i understand that i have the option to seek further independent testing, and that i should obtain genetic counseling to help me understand the results. are there limitations to the testing yes, there are several limitations to wes: 1. at the current time, the test may not reveal 100% of the exome. therefore, there is a possibility that there th personalized genomic medicine laboratory 630 west 168 street department of pathology and cell biology p&s17-401 www.pathology.columbia.edu new york, ny 10032 tel: 212-305-9706 office use fax: 212-342-0420 only: wes sequencing reviewed: lab acc. #: could be a mutation or variation that is causing your condition that is not picked up by the wes test. 2. the wes report is generated based on current medical knowledge. a mutation that is not known to be the cause of a genetic condition today may be shown to be disease-causing in a year or two. we do not generate updated reports for the test, unless we are requested to do so by the patient. there is a fee associated with providing an updated report. 3. wes is not currently validated to detect large-scale alterations in the dna content of the patient s cells. these include losses or duplications of many genes. another genetic test called microarray is available for this purpose. a microarray test might be ordered by your physician before the wes testing. 4. wes may not be able to detect genetic disorders that are caused by expansion of repetitive regions of the genome. one example is fragile x syndrome. if one of these conditions is suspected, your physician should order the appropriate test. 5. wes is not able to detect mutations in the 99% of the dna that is not part of the exome, including parts of the dna that help regulate gene function. 6. wes may detect findings of uncertain significance, which cannot be proven with complete certainty to be the cause of your condition (see types of results described above). 7. finding a disease-causing mutation may not result in a treatment, cure, or a prognosis (knowledge about how a disease is expected to progress). 8. standard lab limitations caused by human error, such as sample contamination or sample mix-up, may occur but are unlikely.  (initial) i understand the limitations to wes 4. when dna testing detects the most common disease-causing changes in a gene, the test result is highly accurate. 5. implications of positive and negative results for your diagnosis predicting the results of the wes in advance is not possible. predicting in advance what the results will mean for your health is also not possible. this is due to the fact that many genes are tested and many different positive results can be obtained. each of these different results will have potentially different implications. a negative result (not finding variants) will not change your clinical diagnosis. 6. who will have access to the results the results of the wes will become a part of your medical record. test results are stored in the laboratory s computer records, and are normally automatically sent to computerized medical records of new york presbyterian hospital and columbia university. if you do not want these results to be sent to these records, you must inform us about this. unless you tell us not to transmit them, the results will become part of your electronic medical record. even if they do not become part of the electronic medical record, the results may be made available to individuals/organizations with legal access to your medical record, on a strict need-to-know basis. those with legal access include, but are not limited to, the physicians and nursing staff directly involved in your care, your current and future insurance carriers, and others specifically authorized by the you or your authorized representative.

relationships: wes may identify familial relationships other than those originally reported. for example, non-paternity (when the reported father of the child is not the biological father) or half sibling-ships (when siblings do not share the same father and mother) would be detected. you may choose whether or not to be informed of this information, in case it is revealed during the testing. 2. discrimination. the genetic non-discrimination law prevents insurance companies from using your genetic information to deny health insurance coverage. however, the law does not cover life insurance, disability insurance or long term care insurance. the detection of an incidental condition may affect your future ability to buy these forms of insurance or get the best insurance rates. by new york state law, your consent is required for the release of these results to insurance companies. however, you may be required to release this information to the insurance companies for your contract with them to be valid. 3. requirement for further testing: wes may identify genetic changes that may require additional testing to evaluate. this could result in anxiety, uncertainty, and additional expenses that may or may not be covered by your insurance. 4. detection of untreatable conditions. wes may identify serious, untreatable genetic conditions. it can result in unexpected psychological trauma, both for you and your family. the detection of such a condition could also affect the health or health care needs of your siblings, children, or other close relatives. 10. statement of financial responsibility  (initial) i understand that i, having requested testing to be performed, am responsible for the cost of this testing and will be required to pay for any/all of the test cost

disorders offered by the personalized genomic medicine laboratory of columbia university medical center overview the human genome contains in excess of 20000 protein coding genes. in a constantly updated encyclopedia of mendelian human disorders, omim, as of october 16, 2012, there are about 3600 phenotypes described in which the molecular basis of the disease is known. there is also an additional 3600 phenotypes listed that have no known molecular basis to date. the number of genes described on the site is past 14,000, and all these genes are thought to be relevant to human disease, although maybe only half of them have a confirmed role in one or more genetic disorders. the current paradigm for genetic diagnosis rests on pcr and microarray-based detection of specific mutations of known significance and/or sanger sequencing that allows detection of previously described, as well as novel mutations, in genes that have been well established to play a role in a specific disease. these methods work well for screening for specific mutations or for demonstration of mutations in a small number of genes, if the gene(s) to test can be largely ascertained based on the clinical phenotype. however, they fall short in cases where the phenotype and genotype correlation is not strong enough to efficiently guide the decision-making process as to what mutation in which gene should be tested for. in cases like congenital hearing loss in which over 100 loci have been implicated, it is often impossible to establish in what order to perform the review of genes linked to the phenotype. even if a more logical phenotype based approach is available, like in the case of muscular dystrophies, the diagnostic odyssey is often too painful and expensive to undertake. since genetic information is changing at a rapid pace, clinicians may be unaware of all known genes and, therefore, fail to order the appropriate tests. ngs allows for simultaneous sequencing of large number of genes that might carry mutations causing the symptoms of a patient at an affordable price. this prevents individual clinician bias in testing decisions and improves diagnostic success rate. we offer four clinical ngs tests at the personalized genomic medicine laboratories at columbia university medical center. these are full mitochondrial genome sequencing (mgs), the columbia combined genetic panel (ccgp), whole exome sequencing (wes) and whole genome sequencing (wgs) tests. the mgs and ccgp tests are for patients whose disease shows a very characteristic phenotype strongly associated with mutations in the mitochondrial genome, or in a few dozen candidate genes. the wes and wgs tests are to be used in situations where one cannot generate a credible list of candidate genes to be tested. these tests interrogate all coding regions or the entire genome, respectively. in addition to identifying known disease causing mutations and probable disease causing mutations in disease associated genes they can also identify entirely new private mutations in genes previously not linked to the disease. confirmation of the disease causing nature of these novel mutations is based on segregation of the mutation in families and structural and functional characteristics of the mutation and the gene itself. th personalized genomic medicine laboratory 630 west 168 street department of pathology

PURPOSE AND BACKGROUND:  You are being asked to volunteer for a research study. This research is  sponsored by the Medical University of South Carolina. The purpose of this  study is to observe patients with Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura  (abbreviated TTP,) a rare disorder causing blood clots to form in small blood  vessels in your body, to determine if any link exists between genetic (DNA)  mutations and the risk of TTP. Another purpose of this study is to collect  DNA samples for future research to learn more about preventing,  diagnosing, and treating diseases.  This study will help researchers guide  future research and learn how to improve the care of patients with your  condition. You are being asked to participate in this study because you  currently have TTP or have been diagnosed with TTP in the past. This study  will be done by creating an electronic database, or registry, for MUSC  patients with TTP so that we can gather as much information as possible  about what caused the disease, how successful current treatment is and  what can be done to improve the care of patients with TTP.  The investigator  in charge of this study is Dr. Charles Greenberg. This study is being done at  the Medical University of South Carolina and will involve up to 100  volunteers.  B. PROCEDURES:  If you agree to be in this study, the following will happen:    1. The researchers will review your medical records to gather information  about your medical history and any factors that could have caused you  to develop TTP. They will look back in your records to the point when  you first developed TTP. They will also review your records periodically  for up to 10 years from the date of your consent to see if you have  relapsed. This information will be entered into the electronic study  database for analysis. The researchers will be gathering the following  data from your medical records:  • Sex  • Race  • Date of presentation and discharge  • Age of onset     IRB Number: Pro00021716 Date Approved 6/16/2015  Expiration Date: 6/15/2016  Page 2 of 8         Version 05/20/2014    • Previous episodes  • Symptoms  • Factors that may have caused you to have TTP  • Routine laboratory data at diagnosis, during admission and  at follow-up  • Treatment required for TTP  • Complications from TTP  • Follow- up information during remission or relapse including  laboratory data  2. You are also being asked if you would like to donate a small blood  sample.  This blood sample donation is optional, and you do not have  to donate the blood sample to be included in this study.  The sample  will be used for genetic (DNA) testing for this study, and part of your  sample may be donated to the MUSC Biomedical Research Bank for  future research if you give permission for that.  The blood sample will  be drawn from you through a needle in your arm, which will be  scheduled at the time of a planned clinical blood draw in an effort to  keep additional needle sticks to an absolute minimum.  Less than 2  teaspoons (7 mL) of blood will be drawn in total for this purpose.     a. Your DNA will be sent to an outside lab to be analyzed.  Your  blood sample will be labeled with a special code that will not  identify you to anyone outside of the study team. The results of  the genetic analysis will not be discussed with participants.  b. Genetic information (DNA) may be obtained from the materials  and stored for future research.  Your samples will be used to  gather information about you or your disease, including possible  family disease genes and will be stored for future research to  learn about, prevent, treat, and cure any type of health problem.   Information and results about your samples will not be added to  your medical records and will be stored in the MUSC Biomedical  Bank.  This biobank works in a way that is sensitive to your  confidential information. Your name and any other information  that directly identifies you will be removed from any specimen  containers. The information about your identity will be replaced  with a coded number. A list that links the coded number to your  name, medical record number and date the sample was collected     IRB Number: Pro00021716 Date Approved 6/16/2015  Expiration Date: 6/15/2016  Page 3 of 8         Version 05/20/2014    will be kept in a locked, secure location.  This information will  only be known to people who are a part of this project, the  biobank staff or to future researchers if approved for use by a  review board that protects people in research. Your materials will  be stored with this coded number so that it can be used to  document that the sample came from you and can be used to  link the samples to you and to your medical record information.  If you chose to withdraw from this study all of your samples will  be destroyed.  Please initial below, indicating if you choose to donate a blood sample for  genetic testing and future, undetermined research.    _____ Yes, I will donate a blood sample to be used in this study for genetic  research.  _____ No, I will not donate a blood sample to be used in this study for  genetic research  ______Yes, I will donate a blood sample to be stored at the biorepository for  future, undesignated research which may include genetic research.  ______No, I will not donate a blood sample to be stored at the biorepository  for future, undesignated research which may include genetic research.     Your participation in this study is voluntary. You may refuse to take part in  or stop taking part in this study at any time. You should notify the  investigator in charge of this study if you decide to withdraw. The address is  Dr. Charles Greenberg  173 Ashley Avenue  Basic Sciences Building Suite 104, MSC 635  Charleston, SC 29425    C. DURATION:  Participants that enroll in this study/registry will be enrolled for up to 10  years from the time of enrollment, unless you decide to withdraw. This may  be done in writing to Dr. Charles Greenberg. If you choose to donate a blood  sample, your sample will be collected for future research and stored in the  MUSC Biomedical Bank for an unknown period-of-time, or until it is used up.    D.RISKS/DISCOMFORTS:      IRB Number: Pro00021716 Date Approved 6/16/2015  Expiration Date: 6/15/2016  Page 4 of 8         Version 05/20/2014    1. Venipuncture: The risks of drawing blood include temporary  discomfort from the needle stick, bruising and infection. Fainting could  occur.     2. Loss of confidentiality: There is a risk of loss of confidentiality of your  protected health information. Every effort will be made to protect the  confidentiality of your information.    3. Genetic Research:  Research to identify genes that cause or contribute to a disease or  trait is an increasingly important way to try to understand the role of  genes in human disease. You have been given this consent form  because the Medical University of South Carolina investigators want to  include your blood samples in a research project, or because they  want to save such biological samples for future research. There are  several things you should know before allowing your blood to be  studied or to be stored.    a. Your blood samples will be stored under your name or some  other type of identifier which could be linked to you. Sometimes  these samples are shared for research purposes with other  investigators at other research sites.  If this is done, the other  investigators would not know your name.   b. In addition to your name, other information about you might be  connected to your blood samples.  For instance, information  about race, ethnicity, sex, your medical history, and so forth  might be available to investigators studying your blood.  Such  information is important for scientific reasons and sometimes  for public health.  It is possible that genetic information might  come to be associated with your racial or ethnic group.  c. Genetic information about you will often apply (in one degree or  another) to family members.  It is not generally the University’s  policy to provide genetic information about you to your family  members.  However, certain studies, called pedigree studies,  share such information among family members. For this and     IRB Number: Pro00021716 Date Approved 6/16/2015  Expiration Date: 6/15/2016  Page 5 of 8         Version 05/20/2014    related research you will be asked if you are willing to share  your genetic information with your family members.  d. You have the right to refuse to allow your blood to be studied or  saved for future research studies.  You may withdraw from this  study at any time and remove any samples that contain  identifiers from research use after the date of your withdrawal.   This means that while the University might retain the identified  samples-the law often requires this-they would not be used for  research.  e. South Carolina law mandates that your genetic information  obtained from any tests or from this research be kept  confidential. Our state law prohibits any insurer using this  information in a discriminatory manner against you or any of  your family in issuing or renewing insurance coverage for you or  your family. Our state law further prohibits our sharing your  genetic information with anyone except in a few narrow  circumstances, one of these being a research project of this  type, approved by the Institutional Review Board and then we  must take all steps to protect your identity.  You will still be  responsible for paying for health care, however.  The Medical  University of South Carolina will not be responsible for such  costs, even if care is needed for a condition revealed during  research or clinical testing.  f. Genetic research raises difficult questions about informing you  and other subjects of any results, or of future results.  Some  people feel anxious about the possibility of having a defective  gene that would place them or their children at risk.  Some  people want to know what is found out about them; others do  not. The risks of knowing include anxiety and other  psychological distress.  The risks of not knowing what is found  include not being aware if there is treatment for the problem  being studied.  But these risks can change depending on  whether there is a treatment or cure for a particular disease,  and on how clear the results are.  If there is a medical reason to  seek specific information from you, your doctor will tell you this.  A process called genetic counseling is often appropriate in such     IRB Number: Pro00021716 Date Approved 6/16/2015  Expiration Date: 6/15/2016  Page 6 of 8         Version 05/20/2014    cases; you should ask your doctor or nurse about this if you  have any questions. In this study, investigators will not tell you  what they find out about you, nor will they contact you if a test  becomes available to diagnose a condition you might have or  later develop.  g. If you are concerned about a potential genetic disorder, you and  your doctor might choose to test specifically for it. This would  require additional blood or tissue samples and would not be part  of this research project.  You should discuss this option with  your doctor or genetic counselor.  h. The presence of a genetic marker does not necessarily mean  that an individual will develop a disease.  Informing people of all  such markers independently of medical need can cause  unnecessary anxiety.  On the other hand, the absence of a  marker does not mean that someone will not get the disease.   Genetic diseases appear as a result of a complex mixture of  hereditary, environmental, behavioral and other factors.  These are the best-known risks and challenges of genetic research. There  might be other risks we do not know about yet.  It is important that you talk  to your doctor, nurse or genetic counselor if you have questions or concerns  about the research study.  E. BENEFITS:  There will be no direct benefit to you from participating in this study.  However, it is hoped that the information gained from the study will benefit  future patients with conditions like yours.   F. COSTS:  There will be no additional costs to you beyond what you would have for  your routine medical care.  The costs of obtaining and storing your samples  will be covered by the study.      G. PAYMENT TO PARTICIPANTS:  You will not be paid for participating in this study. Your samples will not be  sold to researchers.  It is possible that your donated samples may result in  new inventions or discoveries that may have commercial value.  You will not  be paid for the use of any donated samples.

ALTERNATIVES:  The alternative to participating in this study is not to participate. Your care  and treatment will be the same whether you participate in this study or not.     I. STUDENT PARAGRAPH: Your participation or discontinuance will not  constitute an element of your academic performance nor will it be a part of  your academic record at this Institution.    J. EMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION: Your participation or discontinuance will  not constitute an element of your job performance or evaluation nor will it  be a part of your personnel record at this Institution.    Results of this research will be used for the purposes described in this study.  This information may be published, but you will not be identified.  Information that is obtained concerning this research that can be identified  with you will remain confidential to the extent possible within State and  Federal law. The investigators associated with this study, the sponsor, and  the MUSC Institutional Review Board for Human Research will have access to  identifying information. All records in South Carolina are subject to subpoena  by a court of law.  In the event of a study related injury, you should immediately go to the  emergency room of the Medical University Hospital, or in case of an  emergency go to the nearest hospital, and tell the physician on call that you  are in a research study.   They will call your study doctor who will make  arrangements for your treatment.   If the study sponsor does not pay for  your treatment, the Medical University Hospital and the physicians who  render treatment to you will bill your insurance company.   If your insurance  company denies coverage or insurance is not available, you will be  responsible for payment for all services rendered to you.    The data collected on you to this point remains part of the study database  and may not be removed. Your decision not to take part in the study will not  affect your current or future medical care or any benefits to which you are  entitled.  The investigators and/or the sponsor may stop your participation in this  study at any time if they decide it is in your best interest. They may also do  this if you do not follow the investigator’s instructions.

B-1  1. Introduction  We invite you to join this clinical trial, also known as a research study. You’re being asked to  join because you:   Have a diagnosis of severe aplastic anemia (SAA), and    Your SAA can be treated with an allogeneic transplant.  You don’t have a completely  matched related or unrelated donor, but you do have a:  o Partially-matched or completely-matched unrelated umbilical cord blood  (UCB) unit, or   o Half-matched family (haploidentical) bone marrow donor   This study will take at least 3 years and will include 60 participants. Your participation will last  for 1 year after your transplant.   This Consent Form will tell you about the purpose of the study, the possible risks and benefits,  other options available to you, and your rights as a participant in the study.   Everyone who takes part in research at [insert facility name] should know that:   Being in any research study is voluntary.   You may or may not benefit from being in the study.  Knowledge we gain from this study  may benefit others.   If you join the study, you can quit the study at any time.    If you decide to quit the study, it will not affect your care at [insert name of facility or  institution].   Please ask the study staff questions about anything that you do not understand, or if you  would like to have more information.   You can ask questions now or any time during the study.   Please take the time you need to talk about the study with your doctor, study staff, and your  family and friends. It is your decision to be in the study. If you decide to join, please sign and  date the end of the Consent Form.  You and your doctor will discuss other treatment choices if you do not want to participate in this  study.   2. Study Background  The National Institutes of Health (NIH), through the Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical  Trials Network (BMT CTN), is providing staff support and money for this research study. The  BMT CTN and the NIH will make decisions together about how to manage the study.   B-2  An allogeneic transplant uses blood-making cells from a related donor (family member) or an  unrelated donor (not a family member) to replace your diseased blood cells. Before your  transplant, you will get chemotherapy with radiation to destroy the diseased cells.   After chemotherapy, the healthy cells from your donor are given to you. The new cells go into  your bloodstream through an intravenous (IV) catheter (or tube). It’s just like getting blood or  medicine through an IV. The donor cells find their way into your marrow where most often they  grow and start to make healthy new red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.  For this study, the cells used for your transplant will come from 1 of 2 sources:   Umbilical cord blood unit (unrelated donor): Blood collected from the umbilical cord  after a baby is born.  OR   Bone marrow (related donor): Soft, spongy tissue inside of bones. The bone marrow will  come from a half-matched (haploidentical) family member such as a sister, brother, child  or parent. This means that you and the donor have one set of genes (out of two possible)  that are the same, or are half-matched. This is called a haploidentical transplant.  ‘Haplo’ means half.   You and your doctors will decide which donor cell source is best for you based on availability  and experience with using that donor source.   3. Study Purpose   We invite you to take part in this study because you have severe aplastic anemia (SAA) and an  allogeneic transplant is a treatment option for you. We’re doing this study to learn how well  SAA patients do with transplants that use unrelated cord blood and transplants that use  haploidentical bone marrow.  4. Rights to Ask Questions and/or Withdraw  You have the right to ask questions about the study at any time. If you have questions about your  rights as a participant or if you want to leave the study, please contact:   [insert contact info]  Being in this study is voluntary. You can choose not to be in this study or leave this study at any  time. If you choose not to take part or leave this study, it will not affect your regular medical care  in any way.   Your study doctor and study staff will be available to answer any questions that you may have  about taking part in or leaving this study.       B-3  5. Study Treatment and Tests  If you join the study, we will check your health before you start treatment, while you receive  treatment, and for 1 year after your transplant.   Before Your Treatment   You will need to have several check-ups and tests to see if you can be in the study. These check- ups and tests are part of your regular care. They would be done even if you were not part of this  study. These tests include:   Medical history   Physical exam, height, and weight   Blood and urine tests   Heart function tests   Lung (pulmonary) function tests; for children, pulse oximetry test to measure how much  oxygen is in your blood.    Bone marrow tests. These tests are called aspirates or biopsies. Samples of your marrow  will be taken from your hip bone with a large needle.    A pregnancy test if you are a woman and able to have children (if you are pregnant, you  will not be able to join this study).  During Your Treatment    If the check-ups and tests show that you can be in the study, your doctor will decide if you’ll get:   1) Partially-matched or fully-matched unrelated cord blood transplant, or   2) Bone marrow transplant from a half-matched (haplo-identical) family member.  Before Your Transplant:  The conditioning regimen is the combination of chemotherapy drugs (chemo) and radiation  you’ll receive before you get your donor cells. This helps the donor cells start to grow and make  new cells in your bone marrow (engraft).   A common side effect of allogeneic transplant is Graft versus Host Disease (GVHD). It’s a  medical condition that can be very serious (see Risks and Toxicities Related to Transplant under  Section 6: Risks and Discomfort).    GVHD happens because of differences in your immune cells (host) and your donor’s immune  cells (graft). The donor cells might see your cells as foreign and attack them, causing GVHD to  happen. Your doctor will give you drugs to help prevent GVHD from happening.   Your doctor will use the following drugs and radiation to prepare your body for transplant:   B-4  BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK   Optimizing UCB & Haplo for SAA – Protocol 1502                                                    Version 1.0 – December 8, 2016   Thymoglobulin®, also known as anti-thymocyte globulin, rabbit ATG and rATG  (helps the donor cells engraft in your body and is also a GVHD prevention drug)   Fludarabine and Cyclophosphamide (chemotherapy drugs)   Total body irradiation, TBI (radiation therapy given to the whole body to help weaken  your immune system and prevent rejection of transplanted stem cells)  1) If You’re Getting A Cord Blood Transplant:    We’ll give you Thymoglobulin® each day for 4 days starting 13 days before your  transplant (Day -13 through Day -10). Then we’ll give you Fludarabine each day for 5  days starting 6 days before your transplant (Day -6 through Day -2).    You’ll also get Cyclophosphamide for 2 days starting 3 days before your transplant (Day  -3 and Day -2).    Last, you’ll get a low dose of TBI the day before your transplant (Day -1).  Before your transplant, you’ll also get drugs to help prevent GVHD:   We’ll give you Tacrolimus daily starting 3 days before your transplant (Day -3).  Your  doctor will either give you this drug in your vein (IV) or you will take a pill.    We’ll also give you Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) daily starting 3 days before your  transplant (Day -3).  Your doctor will either give you this drug in your vein (IV) or you  will take a pill.    You will continue to take Tacrolimus (or a similar drug called Cyclosporine) for about 6  to 12 months, and MMF for about 6.5 weeks after your transplant or until there are no  signs of GVHD.  After your transplant, you will also get drugs to help speed up the recovery of white blood  cells:   We’ll give you Filgrastim (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, G-CSF) through your  catheter or by injection under your skin 1 day after your transplant (Day +1). You’ll get  Filgrastim every day until your blood counts are at a safe level and then continue for  three additional days before stopping.

The cells  will travel to your bone marrow where they will start to make new, healthy blood cells.  Health Evaluations:  We will test (evaluate) your health during the study. These tests and how often they are  scheduled are standard care for patients receiving an allogeneic transplant. They would be done  even if you were not part of this study. You will be watched closely for any signs and symptoms  of GVHD.   After Your Treatment  Health Evaluations after Transplant:   Routine blood tests (cell counts and liver and kidney function) two or three times per  week until Day 28, then weekly until Day 100, and then at Days 180 and 365.   One of six protocol-required 5 mL (~1 teaspoon) blood samples from a vein in your arm  on Day 7 (the other 5 protocol-required samples will be taken pre-transplant on the days  you receive ATG).   Blood tests to see how well your immune system is working at Day 100, 180, and 365.   Blood tests to find the amount of donor cells in your body on Days 28, 56, 100, 180, and  365.  This is called chimerism.   Blood tests to find out if you have any infections weekly until Day 100.   Physical exam to look for toxicities on Days 28, 56, 100, 180, and 365.   Physical exam to look for GVHD weekly until Day 100 and then at Days 180 and 365.   Health-Related Quality of Life Questionnaires: If you speak English or Spanish and are 8  years of age or older, you will be asked to complete a questionnaire about your quality of  life before your transplant and then at Day 100, Day 180, and Day 365.  6. Risks and Discomforts  You will have side effects while on the study. Side effects can range from mild to very serious.  The risks listed in this section might happen from transplant. These risks might happen if you  have a transplant as part of this study or as standard care. The chances of developing GVHD and  infections are the same if you have a cord blood transplant or haplo-identical transplant. Your  doctor will give you drugs to help lower the side effects, such as feeling sick to your stomach  (nausea). In some cases, side effects can be long lasting or may never go away. The  chemotherapy drugs can cause leukemia years later, but this is rare. These “secondary cancers”  are often very hard to treat and can cause death.  B-8  BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK   Optimizing UCB & Haplo for SAA – Protocol 1502                                                    Version 1.0 – December 8, 2016  Risks and Toxicities Related to Transplant:  The following problems may happen because of your transplant. These risks may happen if a  transplant was done as part of the study or not. The risks are:   Death due to infection or transplant complications:  Patients undergoing transplant for severe  aplastic anemia are at risk of fatal complications due to several complications listed below  (infection, organ damage, graft versus host disease, etc.).  Although approaches to cord blood or  haploidentical transplant included in this study may improve outcomes, in past studies, as many  as 20-40% of patients have had fatal complications using these stem cell sources.  Slow recovery of blood counts: The red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets can be slow  to recover after a cord blood or bone marrow transplant. Until your blood counts recover, you  will need blood and platelet transfusions and you will be at risk for bleeding and infections.  You’ll receive Filgrastim to speed the recovery of the white cells as much as possible.    Graft failure: The stem cells (the “graft”) may fail to grow inside your body. Past experience  suggests that there can be up to a 10 - 15% chance of graft failure. If graft failure occurs, you could  have low blood counts for a long period of time. If your counts don’t recover, you may need to  receive a second transplant. Graft failure can be fatal.  Graft-Versus-Host Disease (GVHD): GVHD happens when the donor cells recognize your body  as foreign and attack it. In most cases, GVHD can be successfully treated. Sometimes GVHD is  severe or difficult to treat and may lead to death. You will be watched closely for this complication  and given drugs to prevent and/or treat it.   Acute GVHD, which can happen 0 – 3 months after transplant, may produce skin rash, nausea,  vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, abnormalities of liver function, and an increased risk of  infection. Chronic GVHD, which can happen 3 months or later after transplant,  may produce skin  rashes, hair loss, thickened dry skin, dry eyes, dry mouth, liver disease, weight loss, diarrhea, and an  increased risk of infection. To confirm the diagnosis of acute or chronic GVHD, you may be asked  to have a biopsy (a small sample of your tissue to look at under the microscope) of your skin, gut,  or, rarely, your liver.   Damage to the vital organs in your body: The transplant could cause problems in any body organ  such as the heart, lungs, liver, gut, kidneys, bladder, or brain. The kidneys and the liver are most  likely to be damaged. Some patients will experience serious lung problems from infections or the  chemotherapy and radiation.   Serious infections: Full and complete recovery of your immune system may take many months.  During this time, there is an increased risk of infections. You will be prescribed certain drugs to  reduce the chance of those infections. However, these treatments do not always work. If you have  an infection, you may have to stay in the hospital longer or be re-hospitalized after transplant.  Although most infections can be successfully treated, some infections may result in death.   Recurrence of disease or a new blood cancer: Your severe aplastic anemia may come back even  B-9  BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK   Optimizing UCB & Haplo for SAA – Protocol 1502                                                    Version 1.0 – December 8, 2016  if the transplant is successful at first. In rare cases, a new blood cancer may develop from the donor  cells. Cyclophosphamide can cause damage to blood cells, which may result in a blood cancer  such as myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML). These blood  cancers usually develop 2 - 10 years after treatment, or 6 years on average. The risk of  developing a new blood cancer after allogeneic transplant is probably less than 2%. If cancer  develops in your blood cells, you may require additional treatment with chemotherapy or another  blood or marrow transplant.  Risk to the unborn: The treatments in this study have not been proven to be safe at any stage of  pregnancy. Therefore, if you are pregnant or nursing, you are not eligible for this study. Women  who can become pregnant must use effective birth control while receiving chemotherapy, TBI, and  drugs to prevent GVHD, and for 1 year after transplant. Effective birth control is defined as the  following:   1. Refraining from all acts of vaginal sex (abstinence)   2. Consistent use of birth control pills  3. Injectable birth control methods (Depo-Provera, Norplant)  4. Tubal sterilization or male partner who has undergone a vasectomy  5. Placement of an IUD (intrauterine device)  6. Use of a diaphragm with contraceptive jelly and/or condoms with contraceptive foam  every time you have sex.  Reproductive Risks:  The drugs used in this research study may damage your reproductive organs, affect your ability to  have children, or possibly cause birth defects if you take them while you are pregnant. It is  important that a woman is not pregnant or breast-feeding and does not become pregnant during  the course of the study. Women may also want to talk to their doctors about freezing eggs prior  to transplant.   If you are a woman and can become pregnant:   You will need to take a pregnancy test before you start the study. You should discuss  ways to prevent pregnancy while you are in the study. Women who have gone through  puberty may find that their menstrual cycle becomes irregular or stops permanently. This  does not mean that you cannot become pregnant. You must still use an effective method  of birth control during your transplant and continue until 1 year after transplant.   Additional Information about MMF:  o MMF could be damaging to an unborn baby if you are pregnant or become  pregnant while receiving the drug.   o MMF can make birth control pills less effective and increase your chances of  B-10  BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK   Optimizing UCB & Haplo for SAA – Protocol 1502                                                    Version 1.0 – December 8, 2016  becoming pregnant while you are taking it.  o If you can become pregnant, you must use 2 effective forms of birth control for 4  weeks before starting MMF, during treatment, and for 6 weeks after stopping  MMF.  o In this study, you will be assigned to receive MMF for about 5 weeks, so you  should not become pregnant during that time. If you think you might become  pregnant or could become pregnant during the upcoming 5 weeks, you should not  join the study.   If you are a man:  Your body may not be able to produce sperm (become sterile). You should talk with your  doctor about banking your sperm before having a transplant. You must still use an  effective method of birth control during your transplant and continue until 1 year after  transplant.  Please check with your doctor to understand more about these risks.  Unforeseen Risks:   New risks might appear at any time during the study. These risks might be different from what is  listed in this Consent Form. We will promptly tell you about new information that may affect  your decision to take part in the study. We may learn new things about these types of transplants  that might make you want to stop being in the study. We will let you know if this happens and you  can decide if you want to continue in the study.   Other Treatments or Medications:  Some medicines react with each other, and it is important that you tell the study doctor or staff  about any other drugs, treatments, or medicines you are taking.  This includes over-the-counter  drugs, vitamins, and herbal treatments.   It is also important that you tell the study staff about any changes to these medications during  your participation in the study.  For more information about risks and side effects, ask your study doctor.     B-11  BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK   Optimizing UCB & Haplo for SAA – Protocol 1502                                                    Version 1.0 – December 8, 2016    Risks and Toxicities Related to Medications: What it means: This type of side effect is expected to happen in more than  Likely 20% of patients. This means that 21 or more patients out of 100 might get  this side effect.  What it means: This type of side effect is expected to happen in 20% of  Less Likely patients or fewer. This means that 20 patients or fewer out of 100 might  get this side effect.  What it means: This type of side effect does not happen often – in fewer  Rare, but than 2% of patients – but is serious when it happens. This means that 1 or  Serious 2 patients (or fewer) out of 100 might get this side effect.    Possible Side Effects of Study Drugs  The most common side effects of the treatments used in this study are listed below. There is also  the risk of very uncommon or unknown side effects.

In transplant patients, it can be caused by some of the drugs used to  prevent or treat GVHD. It can often, but not always, be prevented by very careful control of blood  pressure.      It is very important that you DO NOT eat grapefruit or drink grapefruit juice while taking  Tacrolimus. Grapefruit has an ingredient called bergamottin, which can affect some of the  treatment drugs used in this study. Common soft drinks that have bergamottin are Fresca,  Squirt, and Sunny Delight.   7. Other Treatments It’s optional to join this study. If you choose not to take part, you may still receive treatment with  alternative immune suppressing therapy, new agents, or an allogeneic transplant to treat your  disease. The transplant treatment and evaluations you would receive could be very similar to  what you would receive if you join this study.   Your study doctor will talk with you about your options. If you decide not to participate in this  study, your medical care will not be affected in any way.   Your other choices may include:   Treatment with a partially-matched related or unrelated donor   Treatment with other drugs to suppress the immune system without a transplant   Treatment with drugs aimed at temporarily boosting your blood counts or other new  agents under investigation   Treatment with blood transfusions only   Comfort care  B-15  BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK   Optimizing UCB & Haplo for SAA – Protocol 1502                                                    Version 1.0 – December 8, 2016  Every treatment option has benefits and risks. Talk with your doctor about your treatment  choices before you decide if you will take part in this study. 8. Possible Benefits    Taking part in this study may or may not make your health better. The information from this  study will help doctors learn more about transplants for SAA. It could also help people with  SAA that may need a transplant in the future. 9. New Information Available During the Study    During this research study, the study doctors may learn about new information about the study  drugs or the risks and benefits of the study. If this happens, they will tell you about the new  information.  The new information may mean that you can no longer participate in the study, or that  you may not want to continue in the study.   If this happens, the study doctor will stop your participation in the study and will offer you all  available care to meet your needs and medical conditions.  10. Privacy, Confidentiality and Use of Information  Your confidentiality is one of our main concerns. Study records that have your name will be kept  private as required by law. You will not be identified by name in the central study records. Your  records will be given a unique code number. The key to the code will be kept in a locked file in the  Principal Investigator’s office.  All necessary steps will be taken to avoid you being identified in any public presentations.  The  results of this study treatment may be published in scientific journals in the future, but no patients  (including you) will be identified.

OPTIONAL Blood Samples for Trial-related and Future Research  Studies  This section of the Consent Form is about collection of optional blood samples for trial- specific and future research studies from people who are taking part in the study.   You can choose to give blood samples for optional trial-specific and future research studies if  you want to. You can still be a part of the main study even if you say “no” to giving optional  blood samples for these studies. Please mark your choice at the end of this section.  Researchers are trying to learn more about how the human body processes the drugs used for  transplant and how the body recovers after transplant. This research is meant to gain knowledge  that may help people in the future and make transplants even more successful.   If you agree to provide optional blood samples, here is what will happen:   We’ll take 24 mL (about 5 teaspoons) from your catheter or by a vein in your arm if you are  an adult (> 18 years old), or 12 mL (about 2.5 teaspoons) if you’re a child (< 18 years old).  We’ll collect this sample when you have your 1st check-up, before treatment starts.  o This blood sample will be shipped on the day of collection to a qualified research  laboratory that is partnering with the clinical trial team physicians for an important  study related to this trial.    At the same time, we will collect one additional 3 mL (about ⅔ teaspoon) blood sample if  you are an adult, or 2 mL (about ⅓ teaspoon) if you are a child.  o This blood sample will be sent to the BMT CTN Biorepository for processing and  storage for future genomic research studies. A repository is a place that protects,  stores, and sends out samples for approved research studies. All research samples will  be given a bar code that cannot be linked to you by future researchers testing your  samples. A link to this code does exist. The link is stored at the Data and  Coordinating Center for the Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network  (BMT CTN DCC).  The staff at the Repository where your sample is being stored  does not have a link to this code. Your research samples will continue to be stored at  the BMT CTN Repository until they are used up for approved research.  o These samples will be kept and may be used in research to learn more about immune  recovery, GVHD, severe aplastic anemia, cancer, and other diseases. When the  samples are given to investigators for research, no information about your name,  address, phone number, or other information that will let the researchers know who  you are will be provided.  o DNA from your stored blood samples and your health information might be used in  genome-wide association (GWA) studies for a future project either done or supported  by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Genome-wide association studies are a  B-20  BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK   Optimizing UCB & Haplo for SAA – Protocol 1502                                                    Version 1.0 – December 8, 2016  way for scientists to find genes that have a role in human disease or treatment. Each  study can look at hundreds of thousands of genetic changes at the same time.  o If your coded samples are used in such a study, the researchers are required to add  your test results and sample information into a public research database. This public  database is called the NIH Genotype and Phenotype Database and it is managed by  the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI).  The NCBI will never  have any information that would identify you, or link you to your information or  research samples. However, the results of genetic studies could, in theory, include  identifying information about you.  Your name and other information that could directly identify you (such as address or  social security number) will not be placed into any scientific database. However,  because your genetic information is unique to you, there is a small chance that  someone could trace it back to you. The risk of this happening is small, but may grow  in the future. Researchers have a duty to protect your privacy and to keep your  information confidential.  Benefits  The research that may be done with your blood samples is not designed specifically to help you.  The benefits of research using blood samples include learning more about what causes GVHD,  severe aplastic anemia, cancer, and other diseases, how to prevent them, and how to treat them.   Risks  There is a small risk of an infection or fainting from the blood draw.   A possible risk is the loss of confidentiality about your medical information. We will do our best  to make sure that your personal information is kept private. The chance that this information will  be given to someone else is very small.   Some general things to think about when letting us store your blood samples for research are:    The choice to let us collect and/or store blood samples for future research is up to you.   No matter what you decide to do, it will not affect your care.    If you decide now that your blood samples can be collected and stored for research, you  can change your mind at any time. Just contact your study doctor in writing and let him  or her know that you do not want us to continue storing your blood samples. His/her  mailing address is on the first page of this form. Then any unused blood samples that  remain will no longer be stored for research. However, samples and information that have  already been shared with researchers cannot be taken back or destroyed.   In the future, people who do research on these blood samples may need to know more  about your health. While the study doctor or others involved in running this study may  give the researchers reports about your health, they will not give them your name,  B-21  BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK   Optimizing UCB & Haplo for SAA – Protocol 1502                                                    Version 1.0 – December 8, 2016  address, phone number, or any other information that will let the researchers know who  you are.   Sometimes blood is used for genetic research (about diseases that are passed on in  families). Even if your blood is used for this kind of research, you will not be told of the  results and the results will not be put in your health records.   Your blood will be used only for research and will not be sold. The research done with  your blood may help to develop new products in the future. You will not get paid for any  samples or for any products that may be developed from current or future research.   Reports about research done with your blood will not be given to you or your doctor.   These reports will not be put in your health record. The research will not have an effect  on your care.   Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act  A new federal law (2009) called the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA)  generally makes it illegal for health insurance companies, group health plans, and employers of  15 or more persons to discriminate against you based on your genetic information. Health  insurance companies and group health plans may not request your genetic information that we  get from this research.   This means that they must not use your genetic information when making decisions about your  insurance. Be aware that this new federal law will not protect you against genetic discrimination  by companies that sell life insurance, disability insurance, or long-term care insurance.  Making Your Choice   Please read each sentence below and think about your choice. After reading each sentence,  please indicate your choice below. If you have any questions, please talk to your doctor or nurse,  or call our research review board at [telephone number].  No matter what you decide to do, it will not affect your care.  You can change your mind at any time about allowing us to use your samples and health  information for research. However, samples and information that have already been  shared with researchers cannot be taken back or destroyed.

We invite you to join this research study because you need a transplant to treat your severe  aplastic anemia. We will replace your unhealthy blood cells with blood cells from either a  donated umbilical cord or from one of your family members. The new cells will travel to  your bones and start making healthy cells in your body.   For this study, we will ask you for information about your health (health information) and for  extra blood samples.     Why are you doing this study?  We’re doing this study to learn how well patients with severe aplastic anemia do with  transplants that use unrelated cord blood and transplants that use haploidentical bone  marrow.   What will happen to me if I join the study?  If you say you want to be in the study, we will:    Before your transplant:   o Give you drugs to help your body get ready for the transplant. The drugs  might make you feel sick. Your doctor will watch your health closely.   o Before your transplant: We will collect extra blood (about 1 teaspoon) 5 times  if you receive a cord blood transplant. We will use a small needle to collect  the blood from a vein in your arm, unless you have a central line in which  case the samples will be collected through that central line. We will try to  collect the extra samples at the same time as you have other blood tests done.    After your transplant:   o We will also give you drugs to help your body adjust to the new cells. The  drugs might make you feel sick. Your doctor will keep watching your health  after your transplant.   You will be in the study for 1 year after your transplant. About 60 people will be in the study.

When we collect your blood from a vein in your arm, it may feel like a pinch. It will hurt for  a minute and the place where the needle went might be red and sore. You might get a little  bruise from the needle, but it goes away in a few days.   What if I have questions?  You can ask any questions that you have about the study. If you forget to ask a question and  think of it later, you can call me:   [insert office number].    You can also ask your question the next time you see me.   You can call the study office at any time to ask questions about the study.   How will you use my health information and blood samples?  Your health information and blood samples will be used for this study and for future research  about transplant in patients with severe aplastic anemia.   How will you store my health information and blood samples?  Your blood samples will be sent to a qualified research lab for an important study.   All research samples will be tied to a number. This number will not be linked to your name  or other identifying information.   A. Will the study help me?  We don’t know if this study will help you or not. It may help other people who need a  transplant in the future.  B. Will I be paid to be in the study?  No, you will not be paid to be in the study. It will not cost you anything to be in the study.  C. Do I have to be in this study?  If you don’t want to be in this study, you need to tell us and your parent or guardian.   Your doctor will not be angry or upset if you do not want to join.

providing financial support through the blood and marrow transplant clinical trials network (bmt ctn). b-1 1. introduction we invite you to join this clinical trial, also known as a research study. you re being asked to join because you: have a diagnosis of severe aplastic anemia (saa), and your saa can be treated with an allogeneic transplant. you don t have a completely matched related or unrelated donor, but you do have a: o partially-matched or completely-matched unrelated umbilical cord blood (ucb) unit, or o half-matched family (haploidentical) bone marrow donor this study will take at least 3 years and will include 60 participants. your participation will last for 1 year after your transplant. this consent form will tell you about the purpose of the study, the possible risks and benefits, other options available to you, and your rights as a participant in the study. everyone who takes part in research at [insert facility name] should know that: being in any research study is voluntary. you may or may not benefit from being in the study. knowledge we gain from this study may benefit others. if you join the study, you can quit the study at any time. if you decide to quit the study, it will not affect your care at [insert name of facility or institution]. please ask the study staff questions about anything that you do not understand, or if you would like to have more information. you can ask questions now or any time during the study. please take the time you need to talk about the study with your doctor, study staff, and your family and friends. it is your decision to be in the study. if you decide to join, please sign and date the end of the consent form. you and your doctor will discuss other treatment choices if you do not want to participate in this study. 2. study background the national institutes of health (nih), through the blood and marrow transplant clinical trials network (bmt ctn), is providing staff support and money for this research study. the bmt ctn and the nih will make decisions together about how to manage the study. b-2 an allogeneic transplant uses blood-making cells from a related donor (family member) or an unrelated donor (not a family member) to replace your diseased blood cells. before your transplant, you will get chemotherapy with radiation to destroy the diseased cells. after chemotherapy, the healthy cells from your donor are given to you. the new cells go into your bloodstream through an intravenous (iv) catheter (or tube). it s just like getting blood or medicine through an iv. the donor cells find their way into your marrow where most often they grow and start to make healthy new red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. for this study, the cells used for your transplant will come from 1 of 2 sources: umbilical cord blood unit (unrelated donor): blood collected from the umbilical cord after a baby is born. or bone marrow (related donor): soft, spongy tissue inside of bones. the bone marrow will come from a half-matched (haploidentical) family member such as a sister, brother, child or parent. this means that you and the donor have one set of genes (out of two possible) that are the same, or are half-matched. this is called a haploidentical transplant. haplo means half. you and your doctors will decide which donor cell source is best for you based on availability and experience with using that donor source. 3. study purpose we invite you to take part in this study because you have severe aplastic anemia (saa) and an allogeneic transplant is a treatment option for you. we re doing this study to learn how well saa patients do with transplants that use unrelated cord blood and transplants that use haploidentical bone marrow. 4. rights to ask questions and/or withdraw you have the right to ask questions about the study at any time. if you have questions about your rights as a participant or if you want to leave the study, please contact: [insert contact info] being in this study is voluntary. you can choose not to be in this study or leave this study at any time. if you choose not to take part or leave this study, it will not affect your regular medical care in any way. your study doctor and study staff will be available to answer any questions that you may have about taking part in or leaving this study. b-3 5. study treatment and tests if you join the study, we will check your health before you start treatment, while you receive treatment, and for 1 year after your transplant. before your treatment you will need to have several check-ups and tests to see if you can be in the study. these check- ups and tests are part of your regular care. they would be done even if you were not part of this study. these tests include: medical history physical exam, height, and weight blood and urine tests heart function tests lung (pulmonary) function tests; for children, pulse oximetry test to measure how much oxygen is in your blood. bone marrow tests. these tests are called aspirates or biopsies. samples of your marrow will be taken from your hip bone with a large needle. a pregnancy test if you are a woman and able to have children (if you are pregnant, you will not be able to join this study). during your treatment if the check-ups and tests show that you can be in the study, your doctor will decide if you ll get: 1) partially-matched or fully-matched unrelated cord blood transplant, or 2) bone marrow transplant from a half-matched (haplo-identical) family member. before your transplant: the conditioning regimen is the combination of chemotherapy drugs (chemo) and radiation you ll receive before you get your donor cells. this helps the donor cells start to grow and make new cells in your bone marrow (engraft). a common side effect of allogeneic transplant is graft versus host disease (gvhd). it s a medical condition that can be very serious (see risks and toxicities related to transplant under section 6: risks and discomfort). gvhd happens because of differences in your immune cells (host) and your donor s immune cells (graft). the donor cells might see your cells as foreign and attack them, causing gvhd to happen. your doctor will give you drugs to help prevent gvhd from happening. your doctor will use the following drugs and radiation to prepare your body for transplant: b-4 bmt clinical trials network optimizing ucb & haplo for saa protocol 1502 version 1.0 december 8, 2016 thymoglobulin , also known as anti-thymocyte globulin, rabbit atg and ratg (helps the donor cells engraft in your body and is also a gvhd prevention drug) fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (chemotherapy drugs) total body irradiation, tbi (radiation therapy given to the whole body to help weaken your immune system and prevent rejection of transplanted stem cells) 1) if you re getting a cord blood transplant: we ll give you thymoglobulin each day for 4 days starting 13 days before your transplant (day -13 through day -10). then we ll give you fludarabine each day for 5 days starting 6 days before your transplant (day -6 through day -2). you ll also get cyclophosphamide for 2 days starting 3 days before your transplant (day -3 and day -2). last, you ll get a low dose of tbi the day before your transplant (day -1). before your transplant, you ll also get drugs to help prevent gvhd: we ll give you tacrolimus daily starting 3 days before your transplant (day -3). your doctor will either give you this drug in your vein (iv) or you will take a pill. we ll also give you mycophenolate mofetil (mmf) daily starting 3 days before your transplant (day -3). your doctor will either give you this drug in your vein (iv) or you will take a pill. you will continue to take tacrolimus (or a similar drug called cyclosporine) for about 6 to 12 months, and mmf for about 6.5 weeks after your transplant or until there are no signs of gvhd. after your transplant, you will also get drugs to help speed up the recovery of white blood cells: we ll give you filgrastim (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, g-csf) through your catheter or by injection under your skin 1 day after your transplant (day +1). you ll get filgrastim every day until your blood counts are at a safe level and then continue for three additional days before stopping. see table 1 below for a schedule of

you through your catheter just like a blood transfusion. the cells will travel to your bone marrow where they will start to make new, healthy blood cells. health evaluations: we will test (evaluate) your health during the study. these tests and how often they are scheduled are standard care for patients receiving an allogeneic transplant. they would be done even if you were not part of this study. you will be watched closely for any signs and symptoms of gvhd. after your treatment health evaluations after transplant: routine blood tests (cell counts and liver and kidney function) two or three times per week until day 28, then weekly until day 100, and then at days 180 and 365. one of six protocol-required 5 ml (~1 teaspoon) blood samples from a vein in your arm on day 7 (the other 5 protocol-required samples will be taken pre-transplant on the days you receive atg). blood tests to see how well your immune system is working at day 100, 180, and 365. blood tests to find the amount of donor cells in your body on days 28, 56, 100, 180, and 365. this is called chimerism. blood tests to find out if you have any infections weekly until day 100. physical exam to look for toxicities

are 8 years of age or older, you will be asked to complete a questionnaire about your quality of life before your transplant and then at day 100, day 180, and day 365. 6. risks and discomforts you will have side effects while on the study. side effects can range from mild to very serious. the risks listed in this section might happen from transplant. these risks might happen if you have a transplant as part of this study or as standard care. the chances of developing gvhd and infections are the same if you have a cord blood transplant or haplo-identical transplant. your doctor will give you drugs to help lower the side effects, such as feeling sick to your stomach (nausea). in some cases, side effects can be long lasting or may never go away. the chemotherapy drugs can cause leukemia years later, but this is rare. these secondary cancers are often very hard to treat and can cause death. b-8 bmt clinical trials network optimizing ucb & haplo for saa protocol 1502 version 1.0 december 8, 2016 risks and toxicities related to transplant: the following problems may happen because of your transplant. these risks may happen if a transplant was done as part of the study or not. the risks are: death due to infection or transplant complications: patients undergoing transplant for severe aplastic anemia are at risk of fatal complications due to several complications listed below (infection, organ damage, graft versus host disease, etc.). although approaches to cord blood or haploidentical transplant included in this study may improve outcomes, in past studies, as many as 20-40% of patients have had fatal complications using these stem cell sources. slow recovery of blood counts: the red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets can be slow to recover after a cord blood or bone marrow transplant. until your blood counts recover, you will need blood and platelet transfusions and you will be at risk for bleeding and infections. you ll receive filgrastim to speed the recovery of the white cells as much as possible. graft failure: the stem cells (the graft ) may fail to grow inside your body. past experience suggests that there can be up to a 10 - 15% chance of graft failure. if graft failure occurs, you could have low blood counts for a long period of time. if your counts don t recover, you may need to receive a second transplant. graft failure can be fatal. graft-versus-host disease (gvhd): gvhd happens when the donor cells recognize your body as foreign and attack it. in most cases, gvhd can be successfully treated. sometimes gvhd is severe or difficult to treat and may lead to death. you will be watched closely for this complication and given drugs to prevent and/or treat it. acute gvhd, which can happen 0 3 months after transplant, may produce skin rash, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, abnormalities of liver function, and an increased risk of infection. chronic gvhd, which can happen 3 months or later after transplant, may produce skin rashes, hair loss, thickened dry skin, dry eyes, dry mouth, liver disease, weight loss, diarrhea, and an increased risk of infection. to confirm the diagnosis of acute or chronic gvhd, you may be asked to have a biopsy (a small sample of your tissue to look at under the microscope) of your skin, gut, or, rarely, your liver. damage to the vital organs in your body: the transplant could cause problems in any body organ such as the heart, lungs, liver, gut, kidneys, bladder, or brain. the kidneys and the liver are most likely to be damaged. some patients will experience serious lung problems from infections or the chemotherapy and radiation. serious infections: full and complete recovery of your immune system may take many months. during this time, there is an increased risk of infections. you will be prescribed certain drugs to reduce the chance of those infections. however, these treatments do not always work. if you have an infection, you may have to stay in the hospital longer or be re-hospitalized after transplant. although most infections can be successfully treated, some infections may result in death. recurrence of disease or a new blood cancer: your severe aplastic anemia may come back even b-9 bmt clinical trials network optimizing ucb & haplo for saa protocol 1502 version 1.0 december 8, 2016 if the transplant is successful at first. in rare cases, a new blood cancer may develop from the donor cells. cyclophosphamide can cause damage to blood cells, which may result in a blood cancer such as myelodysplastic syndrome (mds) or acute myeloid leukemia (aml). these blood cancers usually develop 2 - 10 years after treatment, or 6 years on average. the risk of developing a new blood cancer after allogeneic transplant is probably less than 2%. if cancer develops in your blood cells, you may require additional treatment with chemotherapy or another blood or marrow transplant. risk to the unborn: the treatments in this study have not been proven to be safe at any stage of pregnancy. therefore, if you are pregnant or nursing, you are not eligible for this study. women who can become pregnant must use effective birth control while receiving chemotherapy, tbi, and drugs to prevent gvhd, and for 1 year after transplant. effective birth control is defined as the following: 1. refraining from all acts of vaginal sex (abstinence) 2. consistent use of birth control pills 3. injectable birth control methods (depo-provera, norplant) 4. tubal sterilization or male partner who has undergone a vasectomy 5. placement of an iud (intrauterine device) 6. use of a diaphragm with contraceptive jelly and/or condoms with contraceptive foam every time you have sex. reproductive risks: the drugs used in this research study may damage your reproductive organs, affect your ability to have children, or possibly cause birth defects if you take them while you are pregnant. it is important that a woman is not pregnant or breast-feeding and does not become pregnant during the course of the study. women may also want to talk to their doctors about freezing eggs prior to transplant. if you are a woman and can become pregnant: you will need to take a pregnancy test before you start the study. you should discuss ways to prevent pregnancy while you are in the study. women who have gone through puberty may find that their menstrual cycle becomes irregular or stops permanently. this does not mean that you cannot become pregnant. you must still use an effective method of birth control during your transplant and continue until 1 year after transplant. additional information about mmf: o mmf could be damaging to an unborn baby if you are pregnant or become pregnant while receiving the drug. o mmf can make birth control pills less effective and increase your chances of b-10 bmt clinical trials network optimizing ucb & haplo for saa protocol 1502 version 1.0 december 8, 2016 becoming pregnant while you are taking it. o if you can become pregnant, you must use 2 effective forms of birth control for 4 weeks before starting mmf, during treatment, and for 6 weeks after stopping mmf. o in this study, you will be assigned to receive mmf for about 5 weeks, so you should not become pregnant during that time. if you think you might become pregnant or could become pregnant during the upcoming 5 weeks, you should not join the study. if you are a man: your body may not be able to produce sperm (become sterile). you should talk with your doctor about banking your sperm before having a transplant. you must still use an effective method of birth control during your transplant and continue until 1 year after transplant. please check with your doctor to understand more about these risks. unforeseen risks: new risks might appear at any time during the study. these risks might be different from what is listed in this consent form. we will promptly tell you about new information that may affect your decision to take part in the study. we may learn new things about these types of transplants that might make you want to stop being in the study. we will let you know if this happens and you can decide if you want to continue in the study. other treatments or medications: some medicines react with each other, and it is important that you tell the study doctor or staff about any other drugs, treatments, or medicines you are taking. this includes over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, and herbal treatments. it is also important that you tell the study staff about any changes to these medications during your participation in the study. for more information about risks and side effects, ask your study doctor. b-11 bmt clinical trials network optimizing ucb & haplo for saa protocol 1502 version 1.0 december 8, 2016 risks and toxicities related to medications: what it means: this type of side effect is expected to happen in more than likely 20% of patients. this means that 21 or more patients out of 100 might get this side effect. what it means: this type of side effect is expected to happen in 20% of less likely patients or fewer. this means that 20 patients or fewer out of 100 might get this side effect. what it means: this type of side effect does not happen often in fewer rare, but than 2% of patients but is serious when it happens. this means that 1 or serious 2 patients (or fewer) out of 100 might get this side effect. possible side effects of study drugs the most common side effects of the treatments used in this study are listed below. there is also the risk of very uncommon or unknown side effects. all chemotherapy drugs in this study are commonly used in transplant. fludarabine (fludara ) chemotherapy drug likely less likely rare, but serious

known as posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (pres). in transplant patients, it can be caused by some of the drugs used to prevent or treat gvhd. it can often, but not always, be prevented by very careful control of blood pressure. it is very important that you do not eat grapefruit or drink grapefruit juice while taking tacrolimus. grapefruit has an ingredient called bergamottin, which can affect some of the treatment drugs used in this study. common soft drinks that have bergamottin are fresca, squirt, and sunny delight. 7. other treatments it s optional to join this study. if you choose not to take part, you may still receive treatment with alternative immune suppressing therapy, new agents, or an allogeneic transplant to treat your disease. the transplant treatment and evaluations you would receive could be very similar to what you would receive if you join this study. your study doctor will talk with you about your options. if you decide not to participate in this study, your medical care will not be affected in any way. your other choices may include: treatment with a partially-matched related or unrelated donor treatment with other drugs to suppress the immune system without a transplant treatment with drugs aimed at temporarily boosting your blood counts or other new agents under investigation treatment with blood transfusions only comfort care b-15 bmt clinical trials network optimizing ucb & haplo for saa protocol 1502 version 1.0 december 8, 2016 every treatment option has benefits and risks. talk with your doctor about your treatment choices

optional blood samples for trial-related and future research studies this section of the consent form is about collection of optional blood samples for trial- specific and future research studies from people who are taking part in the study. you can choose to give blood samples for optional trial-specific and future research studies if you want to. you can still be a part of the main study even if you say no to giving optional blood samples for these studies. please mark your choice at the end of this section. researchers are trying to learn more about how the human body processes the drugs used for transplant and how the body recovers after transplant. this research is meant to gain knowledge that may help people in the future and make transplants even more successful. if you agree to provide optional blood samples, here is what will happen: we ll take 24 ml (about 5 teaspoons) from your catheter or by a vein in your arm if you are an adult (> 18 years old), or 12 ml (about 2.5 teaspoons) if you re a child (< 18 years old). we ll collect this sample when you have your 1st check-up, before treatment starts. o this blood sample will be shipped on the day of collection to a qualified research laboratory that is partnering with the clinical trial team physicians for an important study related to this trial. at the same time, we will collect one additional 3 ml (about teaspoon) blood sample if you are an adult, or 2 ml (about teaspoon) if you are a child. o this blood sample will be sent to the bmt ctn biorepository for processing and storage for future genomic research studies. a repository is a place that protects, stores, and sends out samples for approved research studies. all research samples will be given a bar code that cannot be linked to you by future researchers testing your samples. a link to this code does exist. the link is stored at the data and coordinating center for the blood and marrow transplant clinical trials network (bmt ctn dcc). the staff at the repository where your sample is being stored does not have a link to this code. your research samples will continue to be stored at the bmt ctn repository until they are used up for approved research. o these samples will be kept and may be used in research to learn more about immune recovery, gvhd, severe aplastic anemia, cancer, and other diseases. when the samples are given to investigators for research, no information about your name, address, phone number, or other information that will let the researchers know who you are will be provided. o dna from your stored blood samples and your health information might be used in genome-wide association (gwa) studies for a future project either done or supported by the national institutes of health (nih). genome-wide association studies are a b-20 bmt clinical trials network optimizing ucb & haplo for saa protocol 1502 version 1.0 december 8, 2016 way for scientists to find genes that have a role in human disease or treatment. each study can look at hundreds of thousands of genetic changes at the same time. o if your coded samples are used in such a study, the researchers are required to add your test results and sample information into a public research database. this public database is called the nih genotype and phenotype database and it is managed by the national center for biotechnology information (ncbi). the ncbi will never have any information that would identify you, or link you to your information or research samples. however, the results of genetic studies could, in theory, include identifying information about you. your name and other information that could directly identify you (such as address or social security number) will not be placed into any scientific database. however, because your genetic information is unique to you, there is a small chance that someone could trace it back to you. the risk of this happening is small, but may grow in the future. researchers have a duty to protect your privacy and to keep your information confidential. benefits the research that may be done with your blood samples is not designed specifically to help you. the benefits of research using blood samples include learning more about what causes gvhd, severe aplastic anemia, cancer, and other diseases, how to prevent them, and how to treat them. risks there is a small risk of an infection or fainting from the blood draw. a possible risk is the loss of confidentiality about your medical information. we will do our best to make sure that your personal information is kept private. the chance that this information will be given to someone else is very small. some general things to think about when letting us store your blood samples for research are: the choice to let us collect and/or store blood samples for future research is up to you. no matter what you decide to do, it will not affect your care. if you decide now that your blood samples can be collected and stored for research, you can change your mind at any time. just contact your study doctor in writing and let him or her know that you do not want us to continue storing your blood samples. his/her mailing address is on the first page of this form. then any unused blood samples that remain will no longer be stored for research. however, samples and information that have already been shared with researchers cannot be taken back or destroyed. in the future, people who do research on these blood samples may need to know more about your health. while the study doctor or others involved in running this study may give the researchers reports about your health, they will not give them your name, b-21 bmt clinical trials network optimizing ucb & haplo for saa protocol 1502 version 1.0 december 8, 2016 address, phone number, or any other information that will let the researchers know who you are. sometimes blood is used for genetic research (about diseases that are passed on in families). even if your blood is used for this kind of research, you will not be told of the results and the results will not be put in your health records. your blood will be used only for research and will not be sold. the research done with your blood may help to develop new products in the future. you will not get paid for any samples or for any products that may be developed from current or future research. reports about research done with your blood will not be given to you or your doctor. these reports will not be put in your health record. the research will not have an effect on your care. genetic information nondiscrimination act a new federal law (2009) called the genetic information nondiscrimination act (gina) generally makes it illegal for health insurance companies, group health plans, and employers of 15 or more persons to discriminate against you based on your genetic information. health insurance companies and group health plans may not request your genetic information that we get from this research. this means that they must not use your genetic information when making decisions about your insurance. be aware that this new federal law will not protect you against genetic discrimination by companies that sell life insurance, disability insurance, or long-term care insurance. making your choice please read each sentence below and think about your choice. after reading each sentence, please indicate your choice below. if you have any questions, please talk to your doctor or nurse, or call our research review board at [telephone number]. no matter what you decide to do, it will not affect your care. you can change your mind at any time about allowing us to use your samples and health information for research. however, samples and information that have already been shared with researchers cannot be taken back or destroyed. b-22 bmt clinical trials network optimizing ucb & haplo for saa protocol 1502 version 1.0 december 8, 2016

join this research study because you need a transplant to treat your severe aplastic anemia. we will replace your unhealthy blood cells with blood cells from either a donated umbilical cord or from one of your family members. the new cells will travel to your bones and start making healthy cells in your body. for this study, we will ask you for information about your health (health information) and for extra blood samples. why are you doing this study we re doing this study to learn how well patients with severe aplastic anemia do with transplants that use unrelated cord blood and transplants that use haploidentical bone marrow. what will happen to me if i join the study if you say you want to be in the study, we will: before your transplant: o give you drugs to help your body get ready for the transplant. the drugs might make you feel sick. your doctor will watch your health closely. o before your transplant: we will collect extra blood (about 1 teaspoon) 5 times if you receive a cord blood transplant. we will use a small needle to collect the blood from a vein in your arm, unless you have a central line in which case the samples will be collected through that central line. we will try to collect the extra samples at the same time as you have other blood tests done. after your transplant: o we will also give you drugs to help your body adjust to the new cells. the drugs might make you feel sick. your doctor will keep watching your health after your transplant. you will be in the study for 1 year after your transplant. about 60 people will be in the study. b-28 bmt clinical trials network optimizing ucb & haplo for saa protocol 1502 version 1.0 december 8, 2016 will the blood draw hurt when we collect your blood from a vein in your arm, it may feel like a pinch. it will hurt for a minute and the place where the needle went might be red and sore. you might get a little bruise from the needle, but it goes away in a few days. what if i have questions you can ask any questions that you have about the study. if you forget to ask a question and think of it later, you can call me: [insert office number]. you can also ask your question the next time you see me. you can call the study office at any time to ask questions about the study. how will you use my health information and blood samples your health information and blood samples will be used for this study and for future research about transplant in patients with severe aplastic anemia. how will you store my health information and blood samples your blood samples will be sent to a qualified research lab for an important study. all research samples will be tied to a number. this number will not be linked to your name or other identifying information. a. will the study help me we don t know if this study will help you or not. it may help other people who need a transplant in the future. b. will i be paid to be in the study no, you will not be paid to be in the study. it will not cost you anything to be in the study. c. do i have to be in this study if you don t want to be in this study, you need to tell us and your parent or guardian. your doctor will not be angry or upset if you do not want to join. you will still need to have treatment for your disease. you can say yes now and change your mind at any time. please talk this over with your parents before you

2019-05-13,../data//gc_consent_and_assent_pdf,../data//gc_consent_and_assent_pdf.txt,"Introduction  You are being asked to participate in GenomeConnect because you (or one of your family  members) have had genetic testing, are considering genetic testing, and/or have been diagnosed  with a genetic condition. The purpose of this registry is to collect information about genetic test  results and health from people that have had or are considering the testing.    If you choose to participate, you may be providing information about yourself, a family member,  or someone you have legal guardianship over. Keep in mind that, throughout this document,  “you” will refer to the person whose information is being shared in this registry. For example, if  you are enrolling your child for GenomeConnect, every time it says “you” we mean “your  child.”  The ClinGen Resource Project, which includes the GenomeConnect registry, is funded by the  National Institutes of Health (NIH).  The registry system has been developed and is hosted by  PatientCrossroads, a company specializing in patient registries.  There is no cost to you to  participate.  What is the purpose of this registry?   Though everyone’s DNA code is similar, there will always be changes from person to  person. We can find these changes by doing genetic testing.  New methods of genetic testing  have allowed doctors and scientists to find more genetic changes than ever before, but we still do  not understand how all of these changes affect our health. GenomeConnect is one way the  information can be gathered for doctors and researchers to understand more. We will share the  genetic and health information you provide to us, separated from your personal identifying  information, in databases approved by GenomeConnect staff, so that further studies and research  can be done to improve health care.   Who will be in the registry?  GenomeConnect is open to adults (age 18 and older) and children (under age 18) who have the  consent of a parent or legal guardian meeting at least one of the following criteria. Please check  the box (or boxes) from the criteria list that describe you:   ☐ Have already had genetic testing  ☐ Are considering genetic testing  ☐ Are family members of someone who has had genetic testing  Adults who are able to consent for themselves must do so, and a parent/guardian must consent  for a child. Children ages 10-17 also have to provide assent to participate. We will contact people  who joined GenomeConnect as children when they turn 18-years old, to get consent for them to  continue participating. A child or adult who is not able to consent (for reasons like a cognitive  disability) can still participate but must get help from their parent or guardian.  Version	2.0 	  Date:	9/Date:	9/77/14/14 	 	  Study	#:	2014-0408 	   ========1========  What will I be asked to do?  All information you provide will initially be stored on the secure PatientCrossroads computer  systems.  1. You will fill out an initial online questionnaire about your health. It will ask about the type(s)  of genetic testing you may have had, the results, and questions about your health and  development.   2. You will upload a copy of your genetic testing report(s), if applicable. This allows us to learn  important information about the particular genetic change(s) listed on a test report. If you do not  have a copy of your report, registry personnel will help you try to get one. Once we receive your  report, we will contact your testing lab and let them know you are participating in our registry.  3. We will stay in touch with you about new surveys and research studies that may apply to you.  Once a year, we’ll contact you to ask you to update your profile information so that it is up-to- date.  What information will be shared, and with whom?  •  The GENETIC TEST RESULTS you provide   •  The HEALTH INFORMATION you provide  This information will be separated, or deidentified, from your personal identifying information  like your name and contact information. We will NEVER share your personal contact  information outside of GenomeConnect without your permission.    Deidentified information will be shared with the following groups so that it can be studied to  improve health care:  •  The Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen): ClinGen is a project funded by the NIH that is  focused on understanding the role genetic changes play in human health and development. GenomeConnect is part of this project. ClinGen is the guardian of the information contained  within the registry and is responsible for collecting, storing and sharing the data, but only  GenomeConnect staff will have access to your personal identifying information, like contact  information, for purposes of recontacting you.  •  Partner databases outside of GenomeConnect that have GenomeConnect approval: These  partner databases are accessible via the Internet, and they include both public access  databases (that anyone can view) and controlled-access databases (only approved users can  view). The public access databases will have limited information (like single genetic variants  listed by themselves, not connected to other genetic variants). It would be unlikely that this  general “one single variant” information could be tracked back and identified as you. To   Version	2.0 	 Date:	9/Date:	9/77/14/14 	 	 Study	#:	2014-0408 	   ========2========  learn more about the databases we have partnered with, please click on this link: Partner  Databases.  •  Other registered users of GenomeConnect:  This could include other participants (patients,  family members, etc.) and members of the scientific community (doctors, researchers, etc.  who want to learn from information in the registry).  •  Geisinger Institutional Review Board (the committee that oversees this research)  ☐ I understand this section about who has access and what deidentified information is shared.  What are the risks to my privacy?  The risks of participating in GenomeConnect, which we feel are minimal, involve the security of  your information and your privacy. Because many genetic changes are rare, there is always the  chance that you could be identified based on your genetic information alone. Other possible risks  include potential breaches in the computer security system. We believe that the risk for these is  low.  GenomeConnect takes these risks very seriously, and we work hard to protect the information we  collect. Partnering with PatientCrossroads, a company specializing in registries, has helped us to  lower risks. PatientCrossroads will store information we receive from you on its private  computer systems, which have tight security measures in place to protect your information. You  can learn more about PatientCrossroads security measures here:   http://www.patientcrossroads.com/securityandprivacy.html.  Before any of the information you provide is shared outside of GenomeConnect, we will remove  your personal information such as name, date of birth, and address, and replace it with a unique  number code only known/seen by approved staff involved with GenomeConnect. This code is  stored in a secure place on the PatientCrossroads server and protected with a password.   Your personal information may be disclosed if we are required by law. Federal Privacy  Regulations provide safeguards for privacy, security, and authorized access. If there are any  breaches, a Federal law, called the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA), has been  put in place to protect you against discrimination by health insurance companies, group health  plans, and most employers. If we think you may have been affected by a breach in the registry’s  computer system or identified by any of your information, we will notify you.   What are the benefits of being part of this registry?  You might not see any immediate personal benefits; however, your participation may help you,  members of your family, and others with the same genetic change or disease in the future by   Version	2.0 	 Date:	9/Date:	9/77/14/14 	 	 Study	#:	2014-0408 	   ========3========  ",28,"introduction you are being asked to participate in genomeconnect because you (or one of your family members) have had genetic testing, are considering genetic testing, and/or have been diagnosed with a genetic condition. the purpose of this registry is to collect information about genetic test results and health from people that have had or are considering the testing. if you choose to participate, you may be providing information about yourself, a family member, or someone you have legal guardianship over. keep in mind that, throughout this document, you will refer to the person whose information is being shared in this registry. for example, if you are enrolling your child for genomeconnect, every time it says you we mean your child. the clingen resource project, which includes the genomeconnect registry, is funded by the national institutes of health (nih). the registry system has been developed and is hosted by patientcrossroads, a company specializing in patient registries. there is no cost to you to participate. what is the purpose of this registry though everyone s dna code is similar, there will always be changes from person to person. we can find these changes by doing genetic testing. new methods of genetic testing have allowed doctors and scientists to find more genetic changes than ever before, but we still do not understand how all of these changes affect our health. genomeconnect is one way the information can be gathered for doctors and researchers to understand more. we will share the genetic and health information you provide to us, separated from your personal identifying information, in databases approved by genomeconnect staff, so that further studies and research can be done to improve health care. who will be in the registry genomeconnect is open to adults (age 18 and older) and children (under age 18) who have the consent of a parent or legal guardian meeting at least one of the following criteria. please check the box (or boxes) from the criteria list that describe you: have already had genetic testing are considering genetic testing are family members of someone who has had genetic testing adults who are able to consent for themselves must do so, and a parent/guardian must consent for a child. children ages 10-17 also have to provide assent to participate. we will contact people who joined genomeconnect as children when they turn 18-years old, to get consent for them to continue participating. a child or adult who is not able to consent (for reasons like a cognitive disability) can still participate but must get help from their parent or guardian. version	2.0 	 date:	9/date:	9/77/14/14 	 	 study	#:	2014-0408 	 ========1======== what will i be asked to do all information you provide will initially be stored on the secure patientcrossroads computer systems. 1. you will fill out an initial online questionnaire about your health. it will ask about the type(s) of genetic testing you may have had, the results, and questions about your health and development. 2. you will upload a copy of your genetic testing report(s), if applicable. this allows us to learn important information about the particular genetic change(s) listed on a test report. if you do not have a copy of your report, registry personnel will help you try to get one. once we receive your report, we will contact your testing lab and let them know you are participating in our registry. 3. we will stay in touch with you about new surveys and research studies that may apply to you. once a year, we ll contact you to ask you to update your profile information so that it is up-to- date. what information will be shared, and with whom the genetic test results you provide the health information you provide this information will be separated, or deidentified, from your personal identifying information like your name and contact information. we will never share your personal contact information outside of genomeconnect without your permission. deidentified information will be shared with the following groups so that it can be studied to improve health care: the clinical genome resource (clingen): clingen is a project funded by the nih that is focused on understanding the role genetic changes play in human health and development. genomeconnect is part of this project. clingen is the guardian of the information contained within the registry and is responsible for collecting, storing and sharing the data, but only genomeconnect staff will have access to your personal identifying information, like contact information, for purposes of recontacting you. partner databases outside of genomeconnect that have genomeconnect approval: these partner databases are accessible via the internet, and they include both public access databases (that anyone can view) and controlled-access databases (only approved users can view). the public access databases will have limited information (like single genetic variants listed by themselves, not connected to other genetic variants). it would be unlikely that this general one single variant information could be tracked back and identified as you. to version	2.0 	 date:	9/date:	9/77/14/14 	 	 study	#:	2014-0408 	 ========2======== learn more about the databases we have

section about who has access and what deidentified information is shared. what are the risks to my privacy the risks of participating in genomeconnect, which we feel are minimal, involve the security of your information and your privacy. because many genetic changes are rare, there is always the chance that you could be identified based on your genetic information alone. other possible risks include potential breaches in the computer security system. we believe that the risk for these is low. genomeconnect takes these risks very seriously, and we work hard to protect the information we collect. partnering with patientcrossroads, a company specializing in registries, has helped us to lower risks. patientcrossroads will store information we receive from you on its private computer systems, which have tight security measures in place to protect your information. you can learn more about patientcrossroads security measures here: http://www.patientcrossroads.com/securityandprivacy.html. before any of the information you provide is shared outside of genomeconnect, we will remove your personal information such as name, date of birth, and address, and replace it with a unique number code only known/seen by approved staff involved with genomeconnect. this code is stored in a secure place on the patientcrossroads server and protected with a password. your personal information may be disclosed if we are required by law. federal privacy regulations provide safeguards for privacy, security, and authorized access. if there are any breaches, a federal law, called the genetic information nondiscrimination act (gina), has been put in place to protect you against discrimination by health insurance companies, group health plans, and most employers. if we think you may have been affected by a breach in the registry s computer system or identified by any of your information, we will notify you. what are the benefits of

We are asking you to participate in two related projects:  1) The Biorepository of the Institute for Heart, Vascular, and Stroke Care “Institute Biorepository”  2) Partners HealthCare Biobank or the “Partners Biobank”    Researchers at Partners HealthCare System (Brigham & Women’s Hospital, Massachusetts  General Hospital, and other Partners institutions) are studying how genes and other factors  affect people’s health and contribute to human disease, such as heart and vascular disease,  stroke, and other health conditions. To perform this research, we are asking Partners patients  to allow us to store their health information and biological samples in the Partners Biobank and  the Institute Biorepository.    Taking part in these biorepositories is up to you. Your decision to participate will not affect your clinical care in any way. Your participation can help us better understand, treat, and even  prevent diseases that affect your loved ones, your family’s future generations, and the larger community.    Some of the people who are eligible to take part in this study may not be able to give consent to take part because of their medical condition. Instead we will ask the person's authorized representative to give consent. Throughout the consent form, “you” always refers to the person  who takes part in the study    What will I have to do to give samples to the tissue bank?    If you decide to sign this consent form, you are providing your consent to participate in both the Page 1 of 11    Consent Form Title: Biorepository_CF_9-25-14 CLEAN  IRB Protocol No: 2013P000494  Sponsor Protocol No: N/A  Consent Form Valid Date: 10/3/2014  IRB Amendment No: AME25  Sponsor Amendment No: N/A  IRB Expiration Date: 6/13/2015  IRB Amendment Approval Date: 10/3/2014      Partners HealthCare System    Research Consent Form  REDCAP:      BIOBANK:    Research Tissue Bank  Subject Identification  Version Date: February 2010      Biorepository of the Institute for Heart, Vascular and Stroke Care and the Partners Biobank.    You will be asked to donate a blood sample of up to 5 tubes (about 3 tablespoons).  We may also use blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, skin biopsy, or other tissue samples  collected as part of your clinical care now or in the future that would otherwise be thrown  away.  We will also look at your medical records now and in the future to update your health  information.  We will store some of your health information in the study database.  We may ask you questions about your health.  We may contact you via telephone to get follow-up information about your health status.  We may also contact you in the future to get additional information and ask if you are  interested in joining other research studies.    How are my samples stored?    Staff at the bank will assign a code number to your samples and health information. Your name,  medical record number, or other information that easily identifies you will not be stored with  your samples or health information. The key that links your identifying information to the code  number will be stored securely in a separate file.      Which researchers can use my samples and what information about me can  they have?    Your coded samples and health information may be shared with researchers at MGH  (Massachusetts General Hospital), BWH (Brigham and Women’s Hospital), and other Partners  institutions. They may also be shared with researchers at non-Partners institutions or with for-  profit companies that are working with Partners researchers. Your samples will not be sold for  profit. We may use your samples and information to develop a new product or medical test to  be sold. The hospital and researchers may benefit if this happens. There are no plans to pay you  if your samples and information are used for this purpose.    We will only share information that identifies you with researchers within Partners who have approval of the Partners ethics board. We will not share information that identifies you with researchers outside Partners.    In order to allow researchers to share research results, agencies such as the National Institutes Page 2 of 11  Consent Form Title: Biorepository_CF_9-25-14 CLEAN  IRB Protocol No: 2013P000494  Sponsor Protocol No: N/A  Consent Form Valid Date: 10/3/2014  IRB Amendment No: AME25  Sponsor Amendment No: N/A  IRB Expiration Date: 6/13/2015  IRB Amendment Approval Date: 10/3/2014      Partners HealthCare System    Research Consent Form  REDCAP:      BIOBANK:    Research Tissue Bank  Subject Identification  Version Date: February 2010      of Health (NIH) have developed secure banks that collect and store research samples and/or data from genetic studies. These central banks may store samples and results from research done using Partners Biobank samples and health information. The central banks may share these samples or information with other qualified researchers to do more studies. Results or samples given to the central banks will not contain information that directly identifies you.  There are many safeguards in place at these banks to protect your privacy.    For what type of research will my samples be used?    We plan to do many types of biological and genetic research with your sample. Research  using your samples and health information is important for the study of virtually all diseases.  Your samples and information may also be used for research on other conditions; for  example, as comparisons to other diseases. This could include a wide variety of conditions  such as heart disease, stroke, brain injury, diabetes, mental illness, HIV/AIDS, cancer, and  others.    Genetic research may include looking at some or all of your genes and DNA to see if there  are links to different types of health conditions. DNA is the material that makes up your  genes. All living things are made of cells. Genes are the part of cells that contain the  instructions which tell our bodies how to grow and work, and determine physical  characteristics such as hair and eye color. Genes are passed from parent to child.    We may create a “cell line” from your sample that will allow researchers to have an  unlimited supply of your cells for future research.    We may use your cells to create pluripotent stem cells. This type of cell can be used to  create different types of tissue, for example, heart, muscle, or lung cells. Your cells might be  used in research that alters genes in the cells in order to study different diseases and normal  healthy processes. Your cells might be mixed with other human cells, animal cells, or grown  in lab animals like mice.    We may also perform a whole genome analysis on your DNA sample. Usually researchers  study just a few areas of your genetic code that are linked to a disease or condition. In whole  genome studies, all or most of your genes are analyzed and used by researchers to study  links between various factors of health and disease.    We may share your samples and any cell lines that are created, your DNA sequence  information, your health information, and results from research with other central tissue or  Page 3 of 11  Consent Form Title: Biorepository_CF_9-25-14 CLEAN  IRB Protocol No: 2013P000494  Sponsor Protocol No: N/A  Consent Form Valid Date: 10/3/2014  IRB Amendment No: AME25  Sponsor Amendment No: N/A  IRB Expiration Date: 6/13/2015  IRB Amendment Approval Date: 10/3/2014    Partners HealthCare System    Research Consent Form  REDCAP:      BIOBANK:    Research Tissue Bank  Subject Identification  Version Date: February 2010      data banks, such as those sponsored by the National Institutes of Health, so that researchers  from around the world can use them to study many conditions. The samples and data will  be sent with only your code number attached, not your name.    It is not possible to list every research project. Also, we cannot predict all of the research questions that will be important over the next years.      How long will my samples and information be kept?    Your samples and health information will be stored in the Biorepository of the Institute for  Heart, Vascular and Stroke Care and the Partners Biobank indefinitely.    Can I stop allowing my samples and information to be stored and used for  research?    Yes. You have a right to withdraw your permission to participate in the Biorepository of the  Institute for Heart, Vascular, and Stroke Care and the Partners Biobank at any time. If you do,  your samples and your information will be destroyed. However, it will not be possible to  destroy samples and information that have already been used or given to researchers. If you  decide to withdraw your permission, you should contact the Partners Biobank staff in writing:    Partners HealthCare Biobank  Phone: 617-525-6700  422-EBRC, 221 Longwood Ave.  FAX: 617-264-6898  Boston, MA 02115  Email: biorepository@partners.org      You may also contact the Institute Biorepository to withdraw your permission:    Institute Biorepository  Office: 617-643-3147  Research Study Staff  Fax: 617-643-9303  32 Fruit Street, Yawkey 5-800  Email: MGHIHVSBIO@partners.org  Massachusetts General Hospital  Boston, MA 02114      Page 4 of 11  Consent Form Title: Biorepository_CF_9-25-14 CLEAN  IRB Protocol No: 2013P000494  Sponsor Protocol No: N/A  Consent Form Valid Date: 10/3/2014  IRB Amendment No: AME25  Sponsor Amendment No: N/A  IRB Expiration Date: 6/13/2015  IRB Amendment Approval Date: 10/3/2014  Partners HealthCare System    Research Consent Form  REDCAP:      BIOBANK:    Research Tissue Bank  Subject Identification  Version Date: February 2010      Will I get results of research done using my samples?    You may receive a newsletter or other information that will tell you about the research discoveries from the tissue bank. This newsletter will not identify you or describe any of your  personal results.    Generally, we will not return individual results from research using your samples and data to you or your doctor. Research using your sample is just a stepping stone in learning about health  and disease. Most of the findings that come from studying your sample will not be relevant to  your personal health. However, in the future, this may change.    It is important to remember that research results are not always meaningful and are not the same as clinical tests. While you should not expect to receive any results from your participation in this research, if experts from the blood and tissue bank decide that research results from your sample are of high medical importance, we will attempt to contact you. In some situations, follow up testing might be needed in a certified clinical lab. You and your medical insurer may  be responsible for the costs of these tests and any follow up care, including deductibles and co-  payments. In case we need to contact you about medically important research results from your sample, please also notify the tissue bank staff listed on page 4 if your address changes.    It is possible that you will never be contacted with individual research findings. This does not mean that you don’t have or won’t develop an important health problem.    In the future, when research results are published, they may show that certain groups (for example, racial, ethnic, or men/women) have genes that are associated with increased risk of a  disease. If this happens, you or others may learn that you are at increased risk of developing a  disease or condition.    What are the risks to me?    The main risk of allowing us to use your samples and health information for research is a potential loss of privacy. We protect your privacy by coding your samples and health information.    There is a risk that information about taking part in genetic research may be used by insurance  companies and/or employers. If you do not share information about taking part in this study,  you will reduce this risk.

We do not think that there will be further risks to your privacy by sharing your samples and whole genome information with other researchers; however we cannot predict how genetic information will be used in the future.    There is a very small risk of bruising or infection from drawing blood similar to what might occur from a routine blood draw that you get for your doctor. Rarely, people feel lightheaded or faint  when their blood is drawn.    If I take part in this research tissue bank, how will you protect my privacy?    In general, health information that identifies you is private under federal law. However, you  should know that in addition to Partners researchers the following people or groups may be  able to see, use, and share your identifiable health information from the research and why they  may need to do so:  Any sponsor(s) of these biorepositories and the people or groups it hires to help with the  biorepositories  The Partners ethics board that oversees the project and the Partners research quality  improvement programs  People from organizations that provide independent accreditation and oversight of  hospitals and research  People or organizations that we hire to do work for us, such as data storage companies,  insurers, and lawyers  Federal and state agencies (such as the Food and Drug Administration, the Department of  Health and Human Services, the National Institutes of Health, and other US or foreign  government bodies that oversee or review research)  While we do not think it likely, under exceptional circumstances, we could be legally  compelled to allow law enforcement or national security agencies access to information  including genetic data.  We share your identifiable health information only when we must, and we ask anyone who  receives it from us to protect your privacy. However, once your information is shared  outside Partners, we cannot promise that it will remain private.    What are the benefits to me?    You will not directly benefit from research conducted on your samples stored in the  Page 6 of 11  Consent Form Title: Biorepository_CF_9-25-14 CLEAN  IRB Protocol No: 2013P000494  Sponsor Protocol No: N/A  Consent Form Valid Date: 10/3/2014  IRB Amendment No: AME25  Sponsor Amendment No: N/A  IRB Expiration Date: 6/13/2015  IRB Amendment Approval Date: 10/3/2014  Partners HealthCare System    Research Consent Form  REDCAP:      BIOBANK:    Research Tissue Bank  Subject Identification  Version Date: February 2010      Biorepository of the Institute for Heart, Vascular and Stroke Care and the Partners Biobank. We  hope that research using the samples and information will help us understand, prevent, treat, or  cure diseases.    You will not receive payment for your samples.    What are the costs to me to take part in the research tissue bank?    There are no costs to you to participate in the Biorepository of the Institute for Heart, Vascular and Stroke Care or the Partners Biobank.    Can I still get medical care within Partners if I don’t take part in this research  tissue bank or if I stop taking part?    Yes. Your decision won’t change the medical care you get within Partners now or in the  future. There will be no penalty, and you won’t lose any benefits you receive now, or have a  right to receive.    Taking part in the bank is up to you. You can decide not to allow your samples and  information to be placed in the bank. If you decide to take part now, you can change your  mind and drop out later.    Whom do I call to answer questions about the research tissue bank?    You may ask more questions about these tissue banks at any time.

biorepository of the institute for heart, vascular, and stroke care institute biorepository 2) partners healthcare biobank or the partners biobank researchers at partners healthcare system (brigham & women s hospital, massachusetts general hospital, and other partners institutions) are studying how genes and other factors affect people s health and contribute to human disease, such as heart and vascular disease, stroke, and other health conditions. to perform this research, we are asking partners patients to allow us to store their health information and biological samples in the partners biobank and the institute biorepository. taking part in these biorepositories is up to you. your decision to participate will not affect your clinical care in any way. your participation can help us better understand, treat, and even prevent diseases that affect your loved ones, your family s future generations, and the larger community. some of the people who are eligible to take part in this study may not be able to give consent to take part because of their medical condition. instead we will ask the person's authorized representative to give consent. throughout the consent form, you

we will also look at your medical records now and in the future to update your health information. we will store some of your health information in the study database. we may ask you questions about

in joining other research studies. how are my samples stored staff at the bank will assign a code number to your samples and health information. your name, medical record number, or other information that easily identifies you will not be stored with your samples or health information. the key that links your identifying information to the code number will be stored securely in a separate file. which researchers can use my samples and what information about me can they have your coded samples and health information may be shared with researchers at mgh (massachusetts general hospital), bwh

researchers. your samples will not be sold for profit. we may use your samples and information to develop a new product or medical test to be sold. the hospital and researchers may benefit if this happens. there are no plans to pay you if your samples and information are used for this purpose. we will only share information that identifies you with researchers within partners who have approval of the partners ethics board. we will not share information that identifies you with researchers outside partners. in order to allow researchers to share research results, agencies such as the

and results from research done using partners biobank samples and health information. the central banks may share these samples or information with other qualified researchers to do more studies. results or samples given to the central banks will not contain information that directly identifies you. there are many safeguards in place at these banks to protect your privacy. for what type of research will my samples be used we plan to do many types of biological and genetic research with your sample. research using your samples and health information is important for the study of virtually all diseases. your samples and information may also be used for research on other conditions; for example, as comparisons to other diseases. this could include a wide variety of conditions such as heart disease, stroke, brain injury, diabetes, mental illness, hiv/aids, cancer, and others. genetic research may include looking at some or all of your genes and dna to see if there are links to different types of health conditions. dna is the material that makes up your genes. all living things are made of cells. genes are the part of cells that contain the instructions which tell our bodies how to grow and work, and determine physical characteristics such as hair and eye color. genes are passed from parent to child. we may create a cell line from your sample that will allow researchers to have an unlimited supply of your cells for future research. we may use your cells to create pluripotent stem cells. this type of cell can be used to create different types of tissue, for example, heart, muscle, or lung cells. your cells might be used in research that alters genes in the cells in order to study different diseases and normal healthy processes. your cells might be mixed with other human cells, animal cells, or grown in lab animals like mice. we may also perform a whole genome analysis on your dna sample. usually researchers study just a few areas of your genetic code that are linked to a disease or condition. in whole genome studies, all or most of your genes are analyzed and used by researchers to study links between various factors of health and disease. we may share your samples and any cell lines that are created, your dna sequence information, your health information, and results from research with other central tissue or page 3 of 11

long will my samples and information be kept your samples and health information will be stored in the biorepository of the institute for heart, vascular and stroke care and the partners biobank

2010 will i get results of research done using my samples you may receive a newsletter or other information that will tell you about the research discoveries from the tissue bank. this newsletter will not identify you or describe any of your personal results. generally, we will not return individual results from research using your samples and data to you or your doctor. research using your sample is just a stepping stone in learning about health and disease. most of the findings that come from studying your sample will not be relevant to your personal health. however, in the future, this may change. it is important to remember that research results are not always meaningful and are not the same as clinical tests. while you should not expect to receive any results from your participation in this research, if experts from the blood and tissue bank decide that research results from your sample are of high medical importance, we will attempt to contact you. in some situations, follow up testing might be needed in a certified clinical lab. you and your medical insurer may be responsible for the costs of these tests and any follow up care, including deductibles and co- payments. in case we need to contact you about medically important research results from your sample, please also notify the tissue bank staff listed on page 4 if your address changes. it is possible that you will never be contacted with individual research findings. this does not mean that you don t have or won t develop an important health problem. in the future, when research results are published, they may show that certain groups (for example, racial, ethnic, or men/women) have genes that are associated with increased risk of a disease. if this happens, you or others may learn that you are at increased risk of developing a disease or condition. what are the risks to me the main risk of allowing us to use your samples and health information for research is a potential loss of privacy. we protect your privacy by coding your samples and health information. there is a risk that information about taking part in genetic research may be used by insurance companies and/or employers. if you do not share information about taking part in this study, you will reduce this risk. page 5 of 11 consent form title: biorepositorycf9-25-14 clean irb protocol no: 2013p000494 sponsor protocol no: n/a consent form

biobank: research tissue bank subject identification version date: february 2010 research results obtained in this study will not be placed in your medical record unless we contact you with a finding of high medical importance. we do not think that there will be further risks to your privacy by sharing your samples and whole genome information with other researchers; however we cannot predict how genetic information will be used in the future. there is a very small risk of bruising or infection from drawing blood similar to what might occur from a routine blood draw that you get for your doctor. rarely, people feel lightheaded or faint when their blood is drawn. if i take part in this research tissue bank, how will you protect my privacy in general, health information that identifies you is private under federal law. however, you should know that in addition to partners researchers the following people or groups may be able to see, use, and share your identifiable health information from the research and why they may need to do so: any sponsor(s) of these biorepositories and the people or groups it hires to help with the biorepositories the partners ethics board that oversees the project and the partners research quality improvement programs people from organizations that provide independent accreditation and oversight of hospitals and research people or organizations that we hire to do work for us, such as data storage companies, insurers, and lawyers federal and state agencies (such as the food and drug administration, the department of health and human services, the national institutes of health, and other us or foreign government bodies that oversee or review research) while we do not think it likely, under exceptional circumstances, we could be legally compelled to allow law enforcement or national security agencies access to information including genetic data. we share your identifiable health information only when we must, and we ask anyone who receives it from us to protect your privacy. however, once your information is shared outside partners, we cannot promise that it will remain private. what are the benefits to me you will not directly benefit from research conducted on your samples stored in the page 6 of 11 consent form title: biorepositorycf9-25-14 clean irb protocol no: 2013p000494 sponsor protocol no: n/a consent

STUDY LOCATION:   University of California, Irvine    STUDY SPONSOR:   University of California, Irvine      WHY IS THIS RESEARCH STUDY BEING DONE?  UC Irvine Medical Center is both a treatment and a research hospital. As a patient here, you may be  treated by some doctors who are also researchers performing studies to improve treatments currently  available. Your doctor is inviting you to participate in the research study described below.    The purpose of this informed consent form is to give you information about the research study. As you  read the consent form, please feel free to discuss any part of it with the study doctor. Reading this  informed consent form and participating in this study are completely voluntary. You are free to decide not  to participate in this research study, and you may decide to stop participating in this research study at  any time. Your doctor and this hospital will continue to care for you regardless of what you decide about  this research study.  UCI IRB Approved: 09-18-2015 | MOD# 17371 | HS# 2014-1709 1 of 9 UCI IRB: Biomed Consent – July 2013    Scientists and clinicians at this institution are working together to discover new ways to treat cancer and  new ways to make current treatments safer and more effective.  In order to conduct this research, we  need to study samples of normal and disease tissue obtained from normal volunteers and our patients.   In order to minimize the discomfort and risk to subjects, we are seeking to collect tissue that is left over  from studies that are required for your evaluation and care and are already being done.  In certain  circumstances (blood draw and bone marrow aspiration) we are seeking to collect a small amount of  tissue in addition to the sample that would be collected for your routine care.  Except for giving samples  of blood, you will not be asked to undergo any procedure solely for the purpose of obtaining a sample for  this study.      You are being asked to take part in this research study because you have or are being evaluated for a  hematologic malignancy, bone marrow disorder, or immune system disorder.       This research study involves the collection and storage of blood and other tissue for later research  testing. It is not currently known how samples donated to the repository will be used at this time. These  research tests may be developed during the time you are a patient at UC Irvine Medical Center, or in  some cases, years later. Any researcher at UCI or their academic collaborators may request permission  to use samples from the repository. Frozen de-identified samples will be provided to researchers after  their plans have been evaluated and approved by the UCI review board that oversees human research  (IRB). These tests may provide additional information that will be helpful in understanding cancer and  other diseases, but it is unlikely that what we learn from these studies will benefit you directly.  These  studies may benefit other patients in the future. The research performed on these samples may include  the study of genetics, including the subject’s DNA code, parts or the DNA code or even whole genome  sequencing. Samples from the repository will not be used to create cell lines.      HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL TAKE PART IN THIS STUDY?    All patients followed in the Hematology/Oncology Clinics at UC Irvine Medical Center with hematologic  malignancy, bone marrow disorder or immunologic disease will be invited to participate in this research  study. Up to 500 people may participate in this research at UCI.      AM I ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS STUDY?  Please note this may not be a complete list of eligibility criteria. We have included a few examples of  study criteria to help you better understand how your eligibility in the study will be determined; your study  team will go through the study eligibility criteria with you to verify if you qualify for participation in this  study.    Inclusion Requirements  You can participate in this study if you have or are being evaluated for a blood disorder    Exclusion Requirements   You cannot participate in this study if you are pregnant.      HOW LONG WILL THE STUDY GO ON?  This study will take a small amount of sample when you get a blood, bone marrow or lymph node biopsy.  This will occur at least one time. By signing this consent you allow us to take a portion of the sample for  subsequent blood draws or biopsies in the future as well.      WHAT PROCEDURES ARE INVOLVED WITH THIS STUDY?  As a subject in this research study you are being asked to donate an extra 30 ml (approximately two  tablespoons) for adults and 10 to 30 ml (approximately one to two tablespoons) for children of blood up  to 4 times per year for as long as you are a patient at this institution.  In order to minimize discomfort and  UCI IRB Approved: 09-18-2015 | MOD# 17371 | HS# 2014-1709 2 of 9 UCI IRB: Biomed Consent – July 2013  inconvenience for you, this blood will be collected at the same time you have other blood work done as  part of your routine care.      If you undergo a bone marrow biopsy, you will be asked to donate up to an additional 15 ml  (approximately one tablespoon) of marrow for adults, 1 to 15 ml (approximately one to 3 teaspoons) for  children depending on age.  Bone marrow biopsy involves inserting a needle into a bone in the hip.  If  you agree to have marrow removed for research, the procedure will only be prolonged for a few seconds  as extra marrow is drawn up through the needle after the sample has been collected for your clinical use.   The needle will not be repositioned or reinserted to obtain marrow for research.  If you undergo a biopsy  of other tissue (such as a lymph node or a tumor), any portion removed as part of your clinical care, but  not consumed for analysis may be stored.      The samples of blood and other tissue we collect may be retained in the laboratory indefinitely. You will  not have access to the samples once they have been donated, nor will you or your doctor be informed of  the results of any testing of your samples.  We may share portions of your tissue with other researchers  working in other institutions.  If your samples are shared with other researchers, your identity will remain  strictly anonymous.  You have the option to have the samples removed from storage and destroyed at  any time by telling your doctor or Dr. Fleischman, orally or in writing.      In the future, people who do research on your blood and/or other tissue may need to know more about  your health and treatment history.  Dr. Fleischman or her designates may review records that exist at the  time samples are collected, as well as medical records that may be generated about you in the future.   Your identity will be removed from any medical record information before it is given to any researcher in  order to protect your privacy.  Your identity will not be released to any participating researcher.      WHAT ARE THE POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS OR RISKS RELATED TO THE STUDY?  We will obtain samples only in the context of your clinical care, no extra blood draws or biopsies are  required. By participating in this research study it may mean that procedures such as bone marrow  biopsy are prolonged by a few seconds. As with all research studies there is a risk of breach of  confidentiality, we have taken precautions to minimize this risk to you.  You should talk to the research team about any side effects you experience while taking part in the  study.  Risks and side effects related to the procedures include:  The risks of a needle stick to draw blood include a mild amount of pain from the needle stick, and  bruising or infection at the site of the blood draw.  If you will undergo a biopsy, those risks will be  discussed with you by your doctor.  Every effort will be made to respect and maintain your privacy. Loss  of confidentiality of your medical information is a risk of participation.     Your tissue may be used for genetic research (about diseases or risks that are passed on in families).   Even if your tissue is used for this kind of research, the results will not be available to you or your doctor.      UNKNOWN RISKS   There may be risks to being in this study that we don't know about now.  You will be informed of any  changes in the way the study will be done and any additional identified risks to which you may be  exposed.    ARE THERE BENEFITS TO PARTICIPATING IN THIS STUDY?  Participant Benefits  You will not directly benefit from participation in this study. No results derived from any research  performed your samples will be provided to you.      UCI IRB Approved: 09-18-2015 | MOD# 17371 | HS# 2014-1709 3 of 9 UCI IRB: Biomed Consent – July 2013    Benefits to Others or Society  Your participation may provide generally useful knowledge for a better understanding of hematologic  malignancies and their treatment in the future.       WHAT OTHER CHOICES DO I HAVE IF I DON’T WANT TO PARTICIPATE?   There are no alternative treatments or procedures available.  The only alternative is not to participate in  this study.      WILL I BE PAID FOR TAKING PART IN THIS STUDY?   Compensation  You will not be compensated for your participation in this research study.    Reimbursement   You will not be reimbursed for any out of pocket expenses, such as parking or transportation fees.       WHAT ARE THE COSTS OF TAKING PART IN THIS STUDY?   There is no cost to you or your insurer/third party payer for participation in this study.       WHAT HAPPENS IF I AM INJURED BECAUSE I TOOK PART IN THIS STUDY?   It is important that you promptly tell the researchers if you believe that you have been injured because of  taking part in this study.  You can tell the researcher in person or call him/her at the number listed at the  top of this form.    If you are injured as a result of being in this study, UCI will provide necessary medical treatment. The  costs of the treatment may be covered by the University of California or billed to you or your insurer just  like other medical costs, depending on a number of factors. The University does not normally provide any  other form of compensation for injury.  For more information about this, you may call UCI Human  Research Protections (949) 824-6068 or (949) 824-2125 or by e-mail at IRB@research.uci.edu      WHAT HAPPENS IF I WANT TO STOP TAKING PART IN THIS STUDY?   You are free to withdraw from this study at any time. If you decide to withdraw from this study, you  should notify the research team immediately. The research team may also end your participation in  this study if you do not follow instructions, miss scheduled visits, the study sponsor decides to stop the  study or your safety and welfare are at risk.    If you experience any of the side effects listed above, if your health worsens, or if you are injured during  the research, you may need to be withdrawn from the study, even if you would like to continue.  The  research team will make this decision and let you know if it is not possible for you to continue.  The  decision may be made to protect your safety and welfare, or because the research plan does not allow  people who develop certain conditions to continue to participate.       If you elect to withdraw or are withdrawn from this research study, you may choose to:  1) Withdraw your specimens from continued use  2) Request to remove the code linking any of your samples to identifiable information  3) Request that no additional access to the subject’s medical record will be continued for the  purposes of the biorepository.    You have the option to have the samples removed from storage and destroyed at any time by telling your  doctor or Dr. Fleischman, orally or in writing.  UCI IRB Approved: 09-18-2015 | MOD# 17371 | HS# 2014-1709 4 of 9 UCI IRB: Biomed Consent – July 2013      HOW WILL INFORMATION ABOUT ME AND MY PARTICIPATION BE KEPT?  Subject Identifiable Data   All identifiable information collected about you will be removed and replaced with a code.  A list linking  the code and your identifiable information will be kept separate from the research data. This includes  your name, age, sex, and medical history. Only the de-identified coded number will remain attached to  your actual specimen.    Data Storage   Research data will be maintained in paper format in a secure location at UCI. Only authorized individuals  will have access to it.      Research data will be stored electronically on a secure network in an encrypted file.    Data Retention   The researchers intend to keep the research data in a repository indefinitely. Other researchers may  have access to the data for future research. Any data shared with other researchers, will not include your  name or other personal identifying information.       WHO WILL HAVE ACCESS TO MY STUDY DATA?  The research team, authorized UCI personnel, and regulatory entities such as the Food and Drug  Administration (FDA) and the Office of Human Research Protections (OHRP), may have access to your  study records to protect your safety and welfare.      Any information derived from this research project that personally identifies you will not be released or  disclosed by these entities without your separate written consent, except as specifically required by law.   Research records provided to authorized, non-UCI entities will not contain identifiable information about  you.  Publications and/or presentations resulting from this study will not include identifiable information  about you.      While the research team will make every effort to keep your personal information confidential, it is  possible that an unauthorized person might see it.  We cannot guarantee total privacy    UCI’s NCI-Designated Cancer Center or the Sponsor registers National Cancer Institute (NCI)-supported  clinical trials with NCI though their Clinical Trials Reporting Program (CTRP) to provide study related  information. The data provided will include the following identifiable information that may identify you:  birth month/year and five-digit zip code.  NCI uses the data to manage and enhance the nation’s  investment in cancer research.      ARE THERE OTHER ISSUES TO CONSIDER IN DECIDING WHETHER TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS  STUDY?   Use of Specimens   Any specimens (e.g., tissue, blood, urine) obtained for this study will become the property of the  University of California, Irvine (UCI).  Once you provide the specimens you may not have access to  them.  Use of the specimens could result in inventions or discoveries that could become the basis for  new products or diagnostic or therapeutic agents.  In some instances, these inventions and discoveries  may be of potential commercial value and may be patented and licensed by the University.  You will not  receive any money or other benefits derived from any commercial products or other products that may be  developed from the use of your specimens.    Genetics   A Federal law, called the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) generally makes it illegal for  health insurance companies, group health plans, and employers of 15 or more persons to discriminate  UCI IRB Approved: 09-18-2015 | MOD# 17371 | HS# 2014-1709 5 of 9 UCI IRB: Biomed Consent – July 2013  against you based on your genetic information. This means that they may not use your genetic  information when making decisions regarding insurability. GINA does not, however, protect against  genetic discrimination by companies that sell life insurance, disability insurance, or long-term care  insurance.  If you would like more information about GINA go to:  http://www.genome.gov/Pages/PolicyEthics/GeneticDiscrimination/GINAInfoDoc.pdf.

of what you decide about this research study. uci irb approved: 09-18-2015 | mod# 17371 | hs# 2014-1709 1 of 9 uci irb: biomed consent july 2013 scientists and clinicians at this institution are working together to discover new ways to treat cancer and new ways to make current treatments safer and more effective. in order to conduct this research, we need to study samples of normal and disease tissue obtained from normal volunteers and our patients. in order to minimize the discomfort and risk to subjects, we are seeking to collect tissue that is left over from studies that are required for your evaluation and care and are already being done. in certain circumstances (blood draw and bone marrow aspiration) we are seeking to collect a small amount of tissue in addition to the sample that would be collected for your routine care. except for giving samples of blood, you will not be asked to undergo any procedure solely for the purpose of obtaining a sample for this study. you are being asked to take part in this research study because you have or are being evaluated for a hematologic malignancy, bone marrow disorder, or immune system disorder. this research study involves the collection and storage of blood and other tissue for later research testing. it is not currently known how samples donated to the repository will be used at this time. these research tests may be developed during the time you are a patient at uc irvine medical center, or in some cases, years later. any researcher at uci or their academic collaborators may request permission to use samples from the repository. frozen de-identified samples will be provided to researchers after their plans have been evaluated and approved by the uci review board that oversees human research (irb). these tests may provide additional information that will be helpful in understanding cancer and other diseases, but it is unlikely that what we learn from these studies will benefit you directly. these studies may benefit other patients in the future. the research performed on these samples may include the study of genetics, including the subject s dna code, parts or the dna code or even whole genome sequencing. samples from the repository will not be used to create cell lines. how many people will take part in this study all patients followed in the hematology/oncology clinics at uc irvine medical center with hematologic malignancy, bone marrow disorder or immunologic disease will be invited to participate in this research study. up to 500 people may participate in this research at uci. am i eligible to participate in this study please note this may not be a complete list of eligibility criteria. we have included a few examples of study criteria to help you better understand how your eligibility in the study will be determined; your study team will go through the study eligibility criteria with you to verify if you qualify for participation in this study. inclusion requirements you can participate in this study if you have or are being evaluated for a blood disorder exclusion requirements you cannot participate in this study if you are pregnant. how long will the study go on this study will take a small amount of sample when you get a blood, bone marrow or lymph node biopsy. this will occur at least one time. by signing this consent you allow us to take a portion of the sample for subsequent blood draws or biopsies in the future as well. what procedures are involved with this study as a subject in this research study you are being asked to donate an extra 30 ml (approximately two tablespoons) for adults and 10 to 30 ml (approximately one to two tablespoons) for children of blood up to 4 times per year for as long as you are a patient at this institution. in order to minimize discomfort and uci irb approved: 09-18-2015 | mod# 17371 | hs# 2014-1709 2 of 9 uci irb: biomed consent july 2013 inconvenience for you, this blood will be collected at the same time you have other blood work done as part of your routine care. if you undergo a bone marrow biopsy, you will be asked to donate up to an additional 15 ml (approximately one tablespoon) of marrow for adults, 1 to 15 ml (approximately one to 3 teaspoons) for children depending on age. bone marrow biopsy involves inserting a needle into a bone in the hip. if you agree to have marrow removed for research, the procedure will only be prolonged for a few seconds as extra marrow is drawn up through the needle after the sample has been collected for your clinical use. the needle will not be repositioned or reinserted to obtain marrow for research. if you undergo a biopsy of other tissue (such as a lymph node or a tumor), any portion removed as part of your clinical care, but not consumed for analysis may be stored. the samples of blood and other tissue we collect may be retained in the laboratory indefinitely. you will not have access to the samples once they have been donated, nor will you or your doctor be informed of the results of any testing of your samples. we may share portions of your tissue with other researchers working in other institutions. if your samples are shared with other researchers, your identity will remain strictly anonymous. you have the option to have the samples removed from storage and destroyed at any time by telling your doctor or dr. fleischman, orally or in writing. in the future, people who do research on your blood and/or other tissue may need to know more about your health and treatment history. dr. fleischman or her designates may review records that exist at the time samples are collected, as well as medical records that may be generated about you in the future. your identity will be removed from any medical record information before it is given to any researcher in order to protect your privacy. your identity will not be released to any participating researcher. what are the possible side effects or risks related to the study we will obtain samples only in the context of your clinical care, no extra blood draws or biopsies are required. by participating in this research study it may mean that procedures such as bone marrow biopsy are prolonged by a few seconds. as with all research studies there is a risk of breach of confidentiality, we have taken precautions to minimize this risk to you. you should talk to the research team about any side effects you experience while taking part in the study. risks and side effects related to the procedures include: the risks of a needle stick to draw blood include a mild amount of pain from the needle stick, and bruising or infection at the site of the blood draw. if you will undergo a biopsy, those risks will be discussed with you by your doctor. every effort will be made to respect and maintain your privacy. loss of confidentiality of your medical information is a risk of participation. your tissue may be used for genetic research (about diseases or risks that are passed on in families). even if your tissue is used for this kind of research, the results will not be available to you or your doctor. unknown risks there may be risks to being in this study that we don't know about now. you will be informed of any changes in the way the study will be done and any additional identified risks to which you may be exposed. are there benefits to participating in this study participant benefits you will not directly benefit from participation in this study. no results derived from any research performed your samples will be provided to you. uci irb approved:

Overview of the NIGMS Human Genetic Cell Repository  The NIGMS Human Genetic Cell Repository (“NIGMS Repository”), a research resource supported by the  National Institutes of Health, collects, stores, and distributes cell cultures, DNA samples and associated de-identified data from individuals with many kinds of disorders, from unaffected family members of  these individuals, and from other healthy people. The purpose of this col ection is to make specimens  available for use in research and teaching and as reference material for use in clinical genetics  laboratories. Submission of samples to the NIGMS Repository may result in valuable research materials  that can be used by scientists to better understand normal and disease processes, and to develop new  diagnostic tests, new treatments, and new ways to prevent diseases.  Sample Collection  The NIGMS Repository col ects blood and biopsy samples. I can choose to donate a blood sample, a skin  biopsy sample, or both to the NIGMS Repository.  Potential Uses of My Sample  The cells and/or DNA derived from my sample may be distributed to scientists for many different types  of research. The cells from my sample may also be used to create modified cell lines or may be  reprogrammed to create induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells to advance research in stem cell biology.  Scientists may use my sample(s) donated to the NIGMS Repository to study my DNA and may share  what they learn with other scientists. Data resulting from the use of my sample may be used in a  research publication. In that event, my name or other personally identifying information will not be  included, as this information is not available to the scientists. I will not be provided with any specific information or results generated from research using my specimen. However, there is a small possibility  that I could learn that a sample described in research came from me and indirectly learn information  about my sample.  In addition to al owing scientists to share data about my sample(s) with each other, I also have the  option (on Page 4 of this Informed Consent Form) to allow more extensive genetic data from my  sample(s) to be made publically available to anyone who wishes to use it. My name and other personal  identifiers will not be linked with my data. Making extensive genetic data publically available has the  potential to enable more people to study the data and speed up the pace of research. It is possible that NIGMS HGCR Informed Consent Form    Page 1 of 4  Form 1401-63 Rev E - 072015      a treatment or cure for a disease could be discovered more quickly if the data is publically available than if it is shared only between scientists.  Scientists are strictly prohibited from distributing the cell line directly derived from my sample, or  material directly isolated from it, in commercial products or services. However, scientists may use  information learned from studies on my sample to develop commercial products or services.  Benefits  There will be no direct benefit or payment to me for participating, but results from research done on my  sample may benefit the community at large or some particular group. It is possible that research done  on my sample(s) could someday contribute to a better understanding of disease, developing a diagnostic  test or finding a treatment or cure for a disease or new ways to prevent diseases.  Risks  The risks of drawing blood are minor transient pain and a slight possibility of infection. The risks of a skin biopsy are mild local pain, some bleeding, the possibility of a small scar, and a slight possibility of infection.  Although the NIGMS Repository takes many measures to protect my privacy, there can be no absolute  guarantee of confidentiality. There is a very small chance that information learned from my sample  about my DNA sequence could be used to identify my sample as having come from me. Should I decide  to allow extensive genetic data from my sample to be made publically available, the risk that I could be  identified from this data is very slightly higher than if this data could only be shared between  researchers.  There is a small chance that some research may yield results that might have a negative impact on me,  my family, other individuals, or groups.  Privacy  I understand that the NIGMS Repository will take measures to protect my privacy. My blood, skin biopsy  specimen, or cell line will be given a code number, and only the code number wil be used to track the  sample. The NIGMS Repository wil not give out my name to the scientists who receive samples. Some  personal health information, such as age at the time of col ection, gender, diagnosis, race, and ethnicity or country of origin will be made available to the NIGMS Repository and scientists.  The Coriell Institute for Medical Research, which operates the NIGMS Repository, has obtained a  Certificate of Confidentiality from the National Institutes of Health to help ensure my privacy. With this certificate, Coriell cannot be forced to disclose information that may identify me, even by a court  subpoena, in any federal, state, or local civil, criminal, administrative, legislative, or other proceedings.  NIGMS HGCR Informed Consent Form    Page 2 of 4  Form 1401-63 Rev E - 072015      Coriell will use the Certificate to resist any demands for information that would identify me, except as  explained below.  The Certificate cannot be used to resist a demand for information from personnel of the United States  Government that is used for auditing or evaluation of federally funded projects or for information that  must be disclosed in order to meet the requirements of the Federal Food and Drug Administration  (FDA).  I understand that a Certificate of Confidentiality does not prevent me or a member of my family from  voluntarily releasing information about me or my donation of a sample to the NIGMS Repository.  Participation  My participation is voluntary, and if I choose not to participate, there will be no penalty or loss of  benefits to which I am entitled.  Withdrawal  If I decide that I no longer wish to have my sample(s) in the NIGMS Repository, I may contact the NIGMS  Repository by e-mail (NIGMS@coriell.org) and request that my remaining undistributed sample(s) and  accompanying clinical information be withdrawn from the NIGMS Repository. However, it will not be  possible to destroy samples and information that have already been distributed to researchers, and it is  not possible to remove any mention of my sample(s) in publications.  Contact Information:  If I have any questions or complications relating to collection of this specimen, I should contact my  personal physician or the healthcare provider who collected the specimen.

This is one of the current consent forms that is under study through in-depth interviews of  participants.    TITLE:  “Genetic Determinants of Peripheral Arterial Disease”    IRB #:  06-002911 00    RESEARCHER: Dr. I. Kullo and colleagues    PROTOCOL LAST APPROVED BY INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD: March 6, 2007    THIS FORM APPROVED: March 6, 2007    This is an important form.  Please read it carefully.  It tells you what you need  to know about this research study.  If you agree to take part in this study, you  need to sign this form.  Your signature means that you have been told about  the study and what the risks are.  Your signature on this form also means that  you want to take part in this study.    Why is this research study being done?    This study is being done to identify new genetic and biochemical markers of peripheral  arterial disease.    How many people will take part in this research study?    The plan is to have 1600 patients with peripheral arterial disease take part in this study at  Mayo Clinic Rochester.    What will happen in this research study?    Your participation in the present study will include:    You will be requested to complete a questionnaire at the start of the study. The  investigators will ask you to provide information about your cardiovascular history and  risk factors for hardening of the arteries.     Page 1 of 8    The investigators will collect a sample of blood (approximately four tablespoons) from a  vein in your arm using a needle. If you are scheduled to have blood tests as part of your  evaluation at Mayo, then at that time the extra blood for this study would be collected.    The investigators plan to use your blood sample to study your inherited genetic material  and other circulating markers that may be involved in the development of vascular  disease.     The investigators may review your medical records to examine and verify your medical  and surgical history, past physical exams, laboratory tests and treatments. Your blood  sample will be coded with a number rather than your name for identification purposes at  the Mayo Clinic Rochester. This code will allow your sample to be used without anyone  knowing that it is your sample just by looking at the label.    Because the genetic tests or other biochemical tests in this study are not used for regular  medical care, you will not be told the results of the test(s). The test results will not be put  in your medical record either.    Additional information you should know:     The researcher and/or Mayo Clinic may earn money from results of this study.     How long will I be in this research study?    Your active participation in this study will be the time it takes to complete the  questionnaire and have your blood drawn. Your blood sample may be stored indefinitely.    Are there reasons I might leave this research study early?    Taking part in this research study is your decision. You may decide to stop at any time.  You should tell the researcher if you decide to stop and you will be advised whether any  additional tests may need to be done for your safety.    In addition, the researchers or Mayo may stop you from taking part in this study at any  time if it is in your best interest, if you do not follow the study rules, or if the study is  stopped.    Will any biological sample(s) be stored and used for research in the future?    If you agree to give your sample, it will be the property of Mayo and may be used for  research by Dr. Kullo and other staff at Mayo Clinic. Your sample of blood will be stored  at Mayo Clinic and given a code (rather than your name) while it is stored and when it is  used in research. This code would allow your sample to be used without anyone knowing   Page 2 of 8    that it is your sample just by looking at the label. In addition, researchers at Mayo who  are not involved with this study may ask to use your sample for further research.     There is a very small chance that some commercial value may result from the use of your  sample. This could include new products like a drug or a test to diagnose a disease. Other  researchers may also pay us to use the sample s in their research. If that would happen,  you will not be offered a share in any profits. You would not have any ownership or  rights to the information or products that are made using the sample.  Some future studies may be for testing the genes you inherited from your parents (also  known as genetic testing). If a researcher finds that future test results may be useful for  your health care, you will be contacted and given the choice to learn the test results. At  that time you will be given general information on the potential risks, benefits, and costs  of choosing to learn the test results. The risks of learning genetic test results may include  emotional upset, insurance or job discrimination, and/or family conflicts from learning  unknown information about your parents or blood relatives. No test results from these  future studies will be put into your medical record unless you choose to learn the results  of the testing. Sometimes results should be released only through a genetic counselor  who can help explain the possible risks and benefits of learning this information. Signing  this consent form shows your permission for the storage and use of your blood sample in  future research.    If you want your sample destroyed at any time, write to the Administrator of the Mayo  Clinic Office for Human Research Protection, 201 Building 4-60, 200 First Street  Southwest, Rochester, Minnesota 55905. Mayo has the right to end storage of the sample  without telling you. If you move please send your new address to Mayo Clinic Rochester,  Section of Registration, 200 First Street Southwest, Rochester, Minnesota 55905.         Page 3 of 8    How do researchers from other institutions get the sample?    Researchers from universities, hospitals, and other health organizations conduct research  using tissue. They may contact Mayo and request samples for their studies and Mayo  may send the tissue sample(s) and some information about you to researchers who  request them, but Mayo will not send your name, address, phone number, social security  number, or any other identifying information with the sample. If these researchers use the  sample for future research and decide that a test result may be useful for your health care,  they may contact the Mayo Clinic and Mayo would then contact you to offer you the  choice to learn the test results.  Signing this consent form shows your permission to give  your blood samples to outside researchers.    What are the risks of this research study?    There are no physical risks involved in this study. This study is being done to gather  information. There may be slight discomfort involved in obtaining a blood sample from a  vein in your arm. Occasionally a bruise can occur at the site where blood was taken. No  other physical risks are anticipated from study participation in this proposed  investigation.    Providing names and addresses of your relatives to the investigators may be perceived by  some family members as an invasion of privacy, and this could impact family  relationships.    In the present study, your blood will be tested for genes that you inherited from your  parents (also known as genetic testing). No test results from this study will be put into  your medical record unless you choose to learn the results of the testing. If the  researchers find that the genetic test results may be useful for your health care, you will  be contacted and given the choice to learn the test results. At that time you will be given  general information on the potential risks, benefits, and costs of choosing to learn the test  results. The risks of learning genetic test results may include emotional upset, insurance  or job discrimination, and/or family conflicts from learning unknown information about  your parents or blood relatives. Sometimes results should be released only through a  genetic counselor who can help explain the possible risks and benefits of learning this  information.    A pregnancy test will not be necessary as part of this study because there is no risk to an  unborn child in this investigation.     Page 4 of 8    Are there benefits to taking part in this research study?    This study may not make your health better. However, we hope that the information  learned from this study will lead to better understanding of early onset vascular disease  and hopefully to new approaches for its prevention, diagnosis and treatment of vascular  disease.    What other choices do I have if I don’t take part in this research study?    This study is only being done to gather information. You may choose not to take part in  this study.    Will I need to pay for the tests and procedures?    You will not need to pay for any procedures and tests which are done just for this  research study. These procedures and tests include collection, preparation and genetic  analysis of your blood sample. However, you and/or your health plan will need to pay for  all other tests and procedures that you would normally have as part of your regular  medical care.    What happens if I am injured because I took part in this research study?    If you have side effects from the study treatment, you need to report them to the  researcher and your regular physician, and you will be treated as needed.  Mayo will give  medical services for treatment for any bad side effects from taking part in this study.   Such services will be free if not covered by a health plan or insurance.  No additional  money will be offered.     What are my rights if I take part in this research study?    Taking part in this research study does not take away any other rights or benefits you  might have if you did not take part in the study. Taking part in this study does not give  you any special privileges. You will not be penalized in any way if you decide not to take  part or if you stop after you start the study. Specifically, you do not have to be in this  study to receive or continue to receive medical care from Mayo Clinic.    You will be told of important new findings or any changes in the study or procedures that  may affect you or your willingness to continue in the study.    Who can answer my questions?     Page 5 of 8    You may talk to Dr. Kullo at any time about any questions or concerns you have on this  study. You may contact Dr. Kullo (or an associate) by calling the Mayo operator at  telephone (507) 284-2511.  You can get more information about Mayo policies, the conduct of this study, or the  rights of research participants from Marcia L.

title: genetic determinants of peripheral arterial disease irb #: 06-002911 00 researcher: dr. i. kullo and colleagues protocol last approved by institutional review board: march 6, 2007 this form approved: march 6, 2007 this is an important form. please read it carefully. it tells you what you need to know about this research study. if you agree to take part in this study, you need to sign this form. your signature means that you have been told about the study and what the risks are. your signature on this form also means that you want to take part in this study. why is this research study being done this study is being done to identify new genetic and biochemical markers of peripheral arterial disease. how many people will take part in this research study the plan is to have 1600 patients with peripheral arterial disease take part in this study at mayo clinic rochester. what will happen in this research study your participation in the present study will include: you will be requested to complete a questionnaire at the start of the study. the investigators will ask you to provide information about your cardiovascular history and risk factors for hardening of the arteries. page 1 of 8 the investigators will collect a sample of blood (approximately four tablespoons) from a vein in your arm using a needle. if you are scheduled to have blood tests as part of your evaluation at mayo, then at that time the extra blood for this study would be collected. the investigators plan to use your blood sample to study your inherited genetic material and other circulating markers that may be involved in the development of vascular disease. the investigators may review your medical records to examine and verify your medical and surgical history, past physical exams, laboratory tests and treatments. your blood sample will be coded with a number rather than your name for identification purposes at the mayo clinic rochester. this code will allow your sample to be used without anyone knowing that it is your sample just by looking at the label. because the genetic tests or other biochemical tests in this study are not used for regular medical care, you will not be told the results of the test(s). the test results will not be put in your medical record either. additional information you should know: the researcher and/or mayo clinic may earn money from results of this study. how long will i be in this research study your active participation in this study will be the time it takes to complete the questionnaire and have your blood drawn. your blood sample may be stored indefinitely. are there reasons i might leave this research study early taking part in this research study is your decision. you may decide to stop at any time. you should tell the researcher if you decide to stop and you will be advised whether any additional tests may need to be done for your safety. in addition, the researchers or mayo may stop you from taking part in this study at any time if it is in your best interest, if you do not follow the study rules, or if the study is stopped. will any biological sample(s) be stored and used for research in the future if you agree to give your sample, it will be the property of mayo and may be used for research by dr. kullo and other staff at mayo clinic. your sample of blood will be stored at mayo clinic and given a code (rather than your name) while it is stored and when it is used in research. this code would allow your sample to be used without anyone knowing page 2 of 8 that it is your sample just by looking at the label. in addition, researchers at mayo who are not involved with this study may ask to use your sample for further research. there is a very small chance that some commercial value may result from the use of your sample. this could include new products like a drug or a test to diagnose a disease. other researchers may also pay us to use the sample s in their research. if that would happen, you will not be offered a share in any profits. you would not have any ownership or rights to the information or products that are made using the sample. some future studies may be for testing the genes you inherited from your parents (also known as genetic testing). if a researcher finds that future test results may be useful for your health care, you will be contacted and given the choice to learn the test results. at that time you will be given general information on the potential risks, benefits, and costs of choosing to learn the test results. the risks of learning genetic test results may include emotional upset, insurance or job discrimination, and/or family conflicts from learning unknown information about your parents or blood relatives. no test results from these future studies will be put into your medical record unless you choose to learn the results of the testing. sometimes results should be released only through a genetic counselor who can help explain the possible risks and benefits of learning this information. signing this consent form shows your permission for the storage and use of your blood sample in future research. if you want your sample destroyed at any time, write to the administrator of the mayo clinic office for human research protection, 201 building 4-60, 200 first street southwest, rochester, minnesota 55905. mayo has the right to end storage of the sample without telling you. if you move please send your new address to mayo clinic rochester, section of registration, 200 first street southwest, rochester, minnesota 55905. page 3 of 8 how do researchers from other institutions get the sample researchers from universities, hospitals, and other health organizations conduct research using tissue. they may contact mayo and request samples for their studies and mayo may send the tissue sample(s) and some information about you to researchers who request them, but mayo will not send your name, address, phone number, social security number, or any other identifying information with the sample. if these researchers use the sample for future research and decide that a test result may be useful for your health care, they may contact the mayo clinic and mayo would then contact you to offer you the choice to learn the test results. signing this consent form shows your permission to give your blood samples to outside researchers. what are the risks of this research study there are no physical risks involved in this study. this study is being done to gather information. there may be slight discomfort involved in obtaining a blood sample from a vein in your arm. occasionally a bruise can occur at the site where blood was taken. no other physical risks are anticipated from study participation in this proposed investigation. providing names and addresses of your relatives to the investigators may be perceived by some family members as an invasion of privacy, and this could impact family relationships. in the present study, your blood will be tested for genes that you inherited from your parents (also known as genetic testing). no test results from this study will be put into your medical record unless you choose to learn the results of the testing. if the researchers find that the genetic test results may be useful for your health care, you will be contacted and given the choice to learn the test results. at that time you will be given general information on the potential risks, benefits, and costs of choosing to learn the test results. the risks of learning genetic test results may include emotional upset, insurance or job discrimination, and/or family conflicts from learning unknown information about your parents or blood relatives. sometimes results should be released only through a genetic counselor who can help explain the possible risks and benefits of learning this information. a pregnancy test will not be necessary as part of this study because there is no risk to an unborn child in this investigation. page 4 of 8 are there benefits to taking part in this research study this study may not make your health better. however, we hope that the information learned from this study will lead to better understanding of early onset vascular disease and hopefully to new approaches for its prevention, diagnosis and treatment of vascular disease. what other choices do i have if i don t take part in this research study this study is only being done to gather information. you may choose not to take part in this study. will i need to pay for the tests and procedures you will not need to pay for any procedures and tests which are done just for this research study. these procedures and tests include collection, preparation and genetic analysis of your blood sample. however, you and/or your health plan will need to pay for all other tests and procedures that you would normally have as part of your regular medical care. what happens if i am injured because i took part in this research study if you have side effects from the study treatment, you need to report them to the researcher and your regular physician, and you will be treated as needed. mayo will give medical services for treatment for any bad side effects from taking part in this study. such services will be free if not covered by a health plan or insurance. no additional money will be offered. what are my rights if i take part in this research study taking part in this research study does not take away any other rights or benefits you might have if you did not take part in the study. taking part in this study does not give you any special privileges. you will not be penalized in any way if you decide not to take part or if you stop after you start the study. specifically, you do not have to be in this study to receive or continue to receive medical care from mayo clinic. you will be told of important new findings or any changes in the study or procedures that may affect you or your willingness to continue in the study. who can answer my questions page 5 of 8 you may talk to dr. kullo at any time about any questions or concerns you have on this study. you may contact dr. kullo (or an associate) by calling the mayo operator at telephone (507) 284-2511. you can get more information about mayo policies, the conduct of this study, or the rights of research participants from

Much of this research is done using human tissue samples (such as blood) and health information. Researchers often study blood and information from people who have health problems and from people who do not. Through such studies, they hope to find new ways to detect, treat, and maybe even prevent or cure health problems. Some of these studies may be about how genes affect health, or how genes affect response to treatment. (Genes, which are made up of DNA, have all the information needed to build and operate a human body.) Some of the studies may lead to new products, such as drugs or tests for diseases. A “biobank” is a collection of stored samples and information. This collection is called the Duke Biobank (or just “the Biobank” in the rest of this form). The director of the Biobank is Dr. Erica Lee. You are being asked to contribute a blood sample and health information to the Duke Biobank. This is because you have been a patient of the Duke University Health System. Research projects like the Duke Biobank include only those people who choose to participate. The purpose of this consent form is to give you information to help you decide if you want to participate. Please read it carefully and take your time making your decision. As the Biobank staff discusses this consent form with you, please ask him/her to explain any words or information that you do not clearly understand. We encourage you to talk with your family and friends before you decide to take part in this research project. The nature of the project, risks, inconveniences, discomforts, and other important information about the project are listed below. Everyone who takes part in research should know that:   Research is intended to gain new knowledge. You may or may not benefit from participating. Participating may also involve some risks.    Participating in research is completely voluntary. You can choose not to participate. If you choose to participate, you can discontinue at any time.    No matter what you decide, now or in the future, it will not affect your medical care.  WHY IS THIS PROJECT BEING DONE? The purpose of the Biobank is to collect and store human tissue samples (such as blood) and health information. The stored materials will then be used by researchers in future studies. The goal is to have at least 20,000 people enroll in the Biobank. WHAT IS INVOLVED IN THIS PROJECT? If you agree to participate, you will be asked to sign this consent form. You will be given a signed copy of the consent form to keep. Here is what will happen next: 1. We will get a blood sample from you. We will draw 50 ml (about 3 tablespoons) of blood from a vein in your arm by needle stick. From this sample, the Biobank will be able to get things like plasma, serum, blood cells, DNA, and RNA. ‘DNA’ is short for deoxyribonucleic acid. DNA stores information in the form of a code. This is the code that you inherit from your parents and that you pass on to your children. Parts of DNA that have complete messages are known as ‘genes.’ Genes give the instructions for building the proteins that make our bodies work.  1  2. We will ask for some information about you and your health.   First, we will ask you to fill out a Biobank Questionnaire. This questionnaire asks for some basic information, such as your name, age, racial and ethnic groups, and family health history. We will contact you no more than once a year to update this information. This will happen for as long as your information is stored in the Biobank.    Second, we will collect some information from your medical records at Duke. Examples include information about lab results, medical procedures, images (such as X-rays), and medications. This is because future researchers need to know if you have any health problems. They may also need to know about any treatments you have had and how well the treatments worked. We will look at your medical record from time to time to update this information. This will happen for as long as your information is stored in the Biobank.    Third, we will collect research data from any future studies done using your sample and information.  3. We will store your sample and information in the Biobank. Your blood and information will be kept in the Biobank along with those from all the other people who participate. They will be stored indefinitely. We will keep using them for research as long as they are useful, unless you decide to stop participating or we close the Biobank. 4. We will let researchers use the materials stored in the Biobank for approved studies. Researchers can apply to study the samples and information stored in the Biobank. This includes researchers from Duke University, as well as from other universities, the government, and drug- or health-related companies. Some researchers will be from the U.S., some may be from other countries around the world. Each application will be reviewed by a science committee at the Biobank. An ethics review will also be done. This kind of review is to make sure that risks are minimized and that the rights and welfare of people who participate in research are protected. If a study is approved, a part of your blood and some information about your health might be distributed to the researchers, along with samples and information from many other people. We will not give researchers your name or any other information that could directly identify you without your permission. 5. We may contact you in the future with offers to participate in additional research. You will not be notified every time your sample and information are used in a study. However, some researchers might apply to do a study for which they would need to contact you. For example, they might want to ask you to give another sample or to fill out a survey. Or they might ask you to do a phone interview or come in to be seen by a researcher or doctor. If a study like this is approved, the Biobank will contact you first. We will tell you about the study so you can decide whether it is okay for us to give the researcher your name. If you give permission, the researcher will then contact you to tell you more about the study. There will be a new consent process just for that study. You can decide then whether to participate or not. We will make sure researchers do not contact you about more than two studies like this per year. 6. Some of your genetic and health information may be placed in scientific databases outside the Biobank. In order to do more powerful research, it is often helpful for researchers to share data they get from studying tissue and health information. They do this by putting it  2  into one or more scientific databases, where it is stored along with data from other studies. Researchers can then study the combined information to learn even more about human health and disease. If you agree to participate in the Biobank, some of your genetic and health information might be placed into one or more scientific databases. There are many different kinds of databases where your information may go. Some are maintained by academic institutions, some by the federal government, and some by private companies. For example, the National Institutes of Health (an agency of the federal government) maintains a database called “dbGaP.” Your name and other information that could directly identify you (such as address or social security number) will never be placed into a scientific database. Nobody will know just from looking at a database that the information belongs to you. However, because your genetic information is unique to you, there is a chance that someone could trace it back to you. The risk of this happening is very small, but may grow in the future if people come up with new ways of tracing information. Researchers will always have a duty to protect your privacy and to keep your information confidential. WHAT ARE THE POSSIBLE RISKS OF THIS PROJECT? Physical Risks. Like any other time you have blood drawn, you may feel brief pain or have some bruising from the needle. Infection, excess bleeding, clotting or fainting is also possible, but unlikely. Privacy Risks. There is a risk that someone could get access to the data we have stored about you. If those data suggested something serious about your health, it could be misused. For example, it could be used to make it harder for you to get or keep a job or insurance. There are laws against this kind of misuse, but they may not give full protection. There may be other unforeseen privacy risks. We believe the chance these things will happen is very small, but we cannot make guarantees. WILL MY INFORMATION BE KEPT PRIVATE? Federal privacy rules give safeguards for privacy, security, and authorized access. We will not give information that identifies you (name, social security number, address, telephone number, or any other direct personal identifier) to anyone without your permission, except if required by law. Your privacy and the confidentiality of your data are very important to us and we will make every effort to protect them. Here are some of the steps we will take:   We will remove your name and any other information that could directly identify you from your sample and information. We will replace this information with a code number. There will be a master list linking the code numbers to names, but it will be kept separate from the samples and information.    Samples will be kept in locked freezers in locked buildings. Health information and research data will be kept on secure computers with very limited access. These computers have many levels of password protection. All Biobank staff sign a pledge to keep your identity a secret.    Research records are separate from medical records. No information that we get or create as part of this project will be placed in your medical record.  3    Researchers who study your sample and information will not know who you are. They will be given only a code number and not any information that directly identifies you. The researchers must sign an agreement that they will not try to find out who you are. They must also promise to keep the coded materials secure.  Your records may be reviewed in order to meet federal or state regulations. Reviewers may include representatives of the Duke University Health System and the Duke University Health System Institutional Review Board. A reviewer who looks at your research record may also need to look at your entire medical record. Your information may also be disclosed to outside reviewers for monitoring purposes. If this happens, it may not be covered by federal patient privacy rules (called ‘HIPAA’), but it will be protected by other federal privacy rules. Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act. There is a Federal law, called the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA), that makes it illegal for health insurance companies, group health plans, and most employers to discriminate against you based on your genetic information. This law will protect you in the following ways:   Health insurance companies and group health plans may not request genetic information from this research.    Health insurance companies and group health plans may not use your genetic information when making decisions regarding your eligibility or premiums.    Employers with 15 or more employees may not use your genetic information when making a decision to hire, promote, or fire you or when setting the terms of your employment.  GINA does not protect you against genetic discrimination by companies that sell life insurance, disability insurance, or long-term care insurance. GINA also does not protect you against discrimination based on an already-diagnosed genetic condition or disease. Certificate of Confidentiality. To further protect you, we have obtained a Certificate of Confidentiality from the National Institutes of Health. With this Certificate, the Biobank cannot be forced to disclose information that may identify you, even by subpoena. A “subpoena” is a command to give information to a judge or court. The Biobank will use the Certificate to resist any demands for information that would identify you, except as explained below.   The Certificate cannot be used to resist a demand for information from personnel of the United States Government that is used for auditing or evaluation of federally-funded projects or for information that must be disclosed in order to meet the requirements of the federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA).    In addition, we will disclose information about you without your consent if the information is something that the law says we must report to state health officials or the state attorney’s office. For example, we have to report sexually transmitted diseases, domestic violence, child abuse, elder abuse, and threats to harm yourself or others.  You should understand that a Certificate does not prevent you from voluntarily releasing information about yourself or your involvement in the Biobank. ARE THERE ANY BENEFITS? You should not expect to get direct health benefits if you decide to participate in the Biobank. The main reason you may want to participate is to help researchers make discoveries that might benefit people in the future.  4  ARE THERE ANY COSTS OR COMPENSATION? There are no costs to you or your insurance for participating in the Biobank. We will give you a $25 gift card to pay you for the time it took for you to join the Biobank. Your sample and information will be used only for research. You should know that research sometimes leads to discoveries that may one day have commercial value. For example, research could lead to new tests, drugs, or other medical products. By agreeing to participate in this project, you authorize the Biobank to make your samples and information available for these uses. In the event that research using samples and information stored in the Biobank leads to a product that could be sold commercially, there are no plans to compensate you. Development of new products usually relies on the study of samples and information from hundreds or thousands of people, not on any one person. Researchers, Duke University, and/or others may own these products and profit from their sale. The Duke University Health System and/or the developers will assert all rights of ownership in the samples and information, as well as all rights arising from use of the samples and information. WILL I FIND OUT THE RESULTS OF THE RESEARCH? You should not expect to get individual results from research done using your samples and information. Researchers must study materials from many people over many years before they can know if the results have meaning. The results will not affect your care right now. They will not be given to your doctor and will not be put in your medical record. There is a small chance that researchers could discover something that might be very important to your health or medical care right now. For example, they might find that you have a condition not previously diagnosed. Or they might find that you have a gene or other risk factor that is known to increase the chance that you or a member of your family could get a disease in the future. We will offer to tell you a finding like this only if it is about a serious disease for which a treatment is available. We will send a letter by certified mail asking you to contact Dr. Lee, the Biobank director. Dr. Lee will arrange a time for you to meet with her or another health care provider to go over the information. Notification will be sent to the last address you provided to us. Therefore it is important that you inform us of any change in your address. Research findings will not be released over the telephone or by mail or email. It is important to note that, even if we find something important to your health, we cannot guarantee that you will be contacted. Research is not the same as medical care. If we do not contact you about your results, do not assume that means everything is okay. Talk to your doctor if you have any questions or concerns about your health. You can get general news about the kinds of studies being done through the Biobank at www.dukebiobank.edu and a quarterly newsletter that you will receive if you join the Biobank. WHAT ABOUT MY RIGHT TO DECLINE PARTICIPATION? Participating in the Biobank is completely voluntary. You can choose to participate or not participate. No matter what you decide, now or in the future, it will not affect your medical care. Refusing to participate or discontinuing participation at any time will involve no penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled.  5  WHAT ABOUT MY RIGHT TO WITHDRAW FROM THIS PROJECT? If you agree to participate in the Biobank, you have the right to discontinue participation at any time. If you decide you want to withdraw, please contact the Duke Biobank office at 919-6663434. We will ask you to indicate in writing on an official participant withdrawal form if you want your unused blood to be destroyed or if your blood (with all identifying information removed that would link the sample to you) could continue to be used for research. Please note that if we have already distributed some of your sample and information for researchers to study, we cannot get them back. Also, we cannot destroy knowledge already gained from the study of samples and information. But if you change your mind about participating in the Biobank, you can tell us not to give your materials out for any more studies. WHOM DO I CALL IF I HAVE QUESTIONS OR PROBLEMS? You should feel free to ask any questions. Your questions should be answered clearly and to your satisfaction. For questions or more information about this project, or if you have complaints, concerns or suggestions about the research, contact Dr. Lee at 919-555-1212 during normal business hours. You can also call the Duke Biobank office at 919-666-3434. You can leave a message at these numbers after hours, on weekends, and on holidays. For questions about your rights as a research participant, or to discuss problems, concerns or suggestions related to the research, or to obtain information or offer input about the research, contact the Duke University Health System Institutional Review Board Office at 919-777-5656.  6  ",33,"traditional consent for biobanking english citation: beskow lm, lin l, dombeck cb, gao e, weinfurt kp. improving biobank consent comprehension: a national randomized survey to assess the effect of a simplified form and review/retest intervention. genet med. 2016 oct 13. doi: 10.1038/gim.2016.157.

(genes, which are made up of dna, have all the information needed to build and operate a human body.) some of the studies may lead to new products, such as drugs or tests for diseases. a biobank is a collection of stored samples and information. this collection is called the duke biobank (or just the biobank in the rest of this form). the director of the biobank is dr. erica lee. you are being asked to contribute a blood sample and health information to the duke biobank. this is because you have been a patient of the duke university health system. research projects like the duke biobank include only those people who choose to participate. the purpose of this consent form is to give you information to help you decide if you want to participate. please read it carefully and take your time making your decision. as the biobank staff discusses this consent form with you, please ask him/her to explain any words or information that you do not clearly understand. we encourage you to talk with your family and friends before you decide to take part in this research project. the nature of the project, risks, inconveniences, discomforts, and other important information about the project are listed below. everyone who takes part in research should know that: research is intended to gain new knowledge. you may or may not benefit from participating. participating may also involve some risks. participating in research is completely voluntary. you can choose not to participate. if you choose to participate, you can discontinue at any time. no matter what you decide, now or in the future, it will not affect your medical care. why is this project being done the purpose of the biobank is to collect and store human tissue samples (such as blood) and health information. the stored materials will then be used by researchers in future studies. the goal is to have at least 20,000 people enroll in the biobank. what is involved in this project if you agree to participate, you will be asked to sign this consent form. you will be given a signed copy of the consent form to keep. here is what will happen next: 1. we will get a blood sample from you. we will draw 50 ml (about 3 tablespoons) of blood from a vein in your arm by needle stick. from this sample, the biobank will be able to get things like plasma, serum, blood cells, dna, and rna. dna is short for deoxyribonucleic acid. dna stores information in the form of a code. this is the code that you inherit from your parents and that you pass on to your children. parts of dna that have complete messages are known as genes. genes give the instructions for building the proteins that make our bodies work. 1 2. we will ask for some information about you and your health. first, we will ask you to fill out a biobank questionnaire. this questionnaire asks for some basic information, such as your name, age, racial and ethnic groups, and family health history. we will contact you no more than once a year to update this information. this will happen for as long as your information is stored in the biobank. second, we will collect some information from your medical records at duke. examples include information about lab results, medical procedures, images (such as x-rays), and medications. this is because future researchers need to know if you have any health problems. they may also need to know about any treatments you have had and how well the treatments worked. we will look at your medical record from time to time to update this information. this will happen for as long as your information is stored in the biobank. third, we will collect research data from any future studies done using your sample and information. 3. we will store your sample and information in the biobank. your blood and information will be kept in the biobank along with those from all the other people who participate. they will be stored indefinitely. we will keep using them for research as long as they are useful, unless you decide to stop participating or we close the biobank. 4. we will let researchers use the materials stored in the biobank for approved studies. researchers can apply to study the samples and information stored in the biobank. this includes researchers from duke university, as well as from other universities, the government, and drug- or health-related companies. some researchers will be from the u.s., some may be from other countries around the world. each application will be reviewed by a science committee at the biobank. an ethics review will also be done. this kind of review is to make sure that risks are minimized and that the rights and welfare of people who participate in research are protected. if a study is approved, a part of your blood and some information about your health might be distributed to the researchers, along with samples and information from many other people. we will not give researchers your name or any other information that could directly identify you without your permission. 5. we may contact you in the future with offers to participate in additional research. you will not be notified every time your sample and

2019-05-13,../data//ic_cell,../data//ic_cell.txt,"USIDNet Repository Informed Consent (existing cell line)    I hereby consent to the submission of a previously collected blood cell, tissue biopsy or  DNA sample from me or my child to the USIDNet DNA and Cell Repository, a  research resource supported by the National Institutes of Health. The Repository  collects, stores, and distributes cel cultures and DNA samples from people with all  forms of primary immunodeficiency disorder, from unaffected family members and from  other healthy people. The samples in the Repository will be maintained by and at  Coriell Cel Repositories in Camden, NJ.    I understand that the cells, cell lines or DNA wil be added to the Repository’s collection.  The purpose of this collection is to make specimens readily available for use in research  and teaching. Since the Primary Immunodeficiency (PI) diseases are rare, donation of  this sample to the Repository may give a broader group of scientists access to rare  research materials from patients and families affected with Primary Immunodeficiency. It  is hoped that wider scientific access and study may help to improve understanding of  these diseases and to develop new diagnostic tests and new treatments for these and  other disorders.    The Repository will take strong measures to protect the privacy of my child or me. Al  identifying information will be removed from the cel or DNA specimen by my doctor  before the sample is submitted to the Repository. The specimen will be given a unique  code number for future identification and the record maintained by the Repository wil  only contain general information such as age, sex, state of residence, diagnosis and  molecular defect (if known). The USIDNet Repository wil not have my name, address or  other specific identifying information to link the sample specifically to me or my child and  therefore it is very unlikely that anyone would be able to determine in the future that the  sample was taken from me or my child.    Because the purpose of this Repository is to provide the research community with cell  and DNA samples from patients with rare defects in their immune systems while at the  same time protecting the privacy of those donors, the Repository will not be able report  back to me any information about research findings that may be made on my specific  sample. The link between the identifying number given to the sample and my name wil  be broken. However I do understand that a potential link may remain between the  sample and me if the USIDNet Repository keeps a record of the name and address of  the physician who submitted this sample. In this event the USIDNet Repository could  1    contact my doctor and in this way potentially transmit back to me research results or a  request for me to participate in additional studies – although the Repository would stil  not have my identity in its records and would not have enough information to contact me  without the assistance of my doctor. If my doctor is unavailable or is unable to contact  me for some reason, I understand that no contact or exchange of information between  the Repository and me concerning my sample will be possible – nor will it be possible  for me to request removal of my sample from the collection once it has been de-  identified and submitted.    I would ( ) would not ( ) like to have my doctor’s name remain linked to  my coded sample in the Repository’s records.    I would ( ) would not ( ) like to be contacted by my doctor in the future  about the results of research studies performed on my sample or with  possible opportunities for me to join additional research studies.    There will be no direct benefit or payment to me or my child for participating, but the  sample may benefit the community at large or some particular group. The sample will  stay in the Repository indefinitely and I will not be able to withdraw it sometime in the  future.    My donation to the Repository is voluntary, and if I choose not to participate there will be  no penalty or loss of benefits to which I or my child is entitled.

My Human Biological Sample & 2.  My University of Michigan Health System (UMHS) Information Michigan Institute for Clinical and Health Research (MICHR) Genomic DNA  For use in Research: BioLibrary Laws about human research at the University of Michigan can be hard to understand. There are three key points you  need to know before you join this study: 1.  Institutional Review Board Approval.  An Institutional Review Board, or IRB, must approve or excuse all research  done with humans. The MICHR Genomic DNA BioLibrary has IRB approval. You can see proof at the top of this page.  2.  Elements of Consent.  You must be informed about the project and agree on your own to join.  This is called  “informed consent.” The BioLibrary pamphlet has the details that you need to know. In general, you need to understand  that: • Your blood sample and health records are called your “book.” They will be used for research as long as the  BioLibrary exists. We will stop using your “book” for new research if you ask to have it removed.  • Your “book” will be stored and safe. Only approved researchers can look it at.  However, sometimes, someone  who is not approved might look at your “book.” You can read more about who can see your “book” in section C of  the pamphlet.  • There are a few risks related to giving a blood sample and sharing your health records. This is true even if your  name is not on your information. • You will not directly benefit from the research that your “book” is used for. • You might help health research more by enrolling in other studies.  • It's up to you whether or not you join the BioLibrary. Your choice will not affect the health care that you get from  UMHS. You can withdraw from the study at any time without any harm to you.  • You can find more information about the BioLibrary here: 1. MICHR (http://www.michr.umich.edu, 734-763-7098)  1. The Medical School IRB (http://www.med.umich.edu/irbmed/) 3. HIPAA Privacy Rule.  The use of your health information is watched and kept safe by the Insurance Portability and  Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA, Public Law 104-191). You can read more about this act on the second page. _____ (Initial here if you understand and accept the HIPPA Privacy Rule)  Required Consent: 1. I was given a pamphlet that describes this project in detail.  I give permission to the MICHR Genomic DNA BioLibrary to  collect and use my blood sample and UMHS health records.  (Initial which blank you agree to):  _____ without any limits  _____ only for studies related to my illnesses  _____ only for use by researchers at or associated with the University of Michigan  _____ other limits (please give details):______________________________________________ 2.  I also agree to be interviewed to assess my informed consent. The answers will be used to improve the way informed  consent is described to volunteers in this study. Optional Consent: 1.  I am willing to be contacted for more information by researchers who receive approval from an IRB to use my Book.  __yes __ no 2.  I would like to receive updates from the BioLibrary on progress and approved studies.  __yes  __ no (Information about the MICHR BioLibrary will also be posted on the web.) __________________________ ________________________________  ______________ (Participant Name Printed) (Participant Signature) (Date) MICRH Genomic DNA BioLibrary 1/11/2012 Vs. 6 Consent Form, Page 1  Study ID: HUM00041560   IRB: IRBMED   Date Approved: 1/10/2012   Expiration Date: 12/4/2012 __________________________ ________________________________  ______________ (Coordinator Name Printed) (Cordinator Signature) (Date) Explanation Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996  (HIPAA, Public Law 104-191), This page describes how your privacy will be protected in this study. What can researchers or other people see about me?  If you want to participate in this project, you will need to sign the consent form. Researchers will be allowed to  use and share your information for their studies if you sign the informed consent.  Your health information may  be taken from:  • Any hospital or doctor's office records. This may include test results from x-rays, blood tests or  urine tests.   • Mental health care records.  • Alcohol or substance abuse treatment records. • Your AIDS/HIV status. • All records related to your illness, your treatment, and your response to the treatment. • Billing information. How will my privacy be kept safe? We will do everything we can to protect your privacy. To do this, we will not link your health information with  your name or social security number to your blood sample.  This is called “de-identification.” Researchers will: • Know many things about you, such as your age, gender, race and health history.  • Not know your name and address.  • Not be able to link you, your name, or address with your health information.   Sometimes, there are ways researchers could find out who you are: 1. If the de-identification process is not done right.   There is a very slight chance that this could happen, though we have done all that we can to be  sure it does not.  2. If the BioLibrary is required by law to give out your health information.  This may happen during a national emergency or major criminal investigation.  The University will  do what it can to protect your information. But, the University must also follow the law. 3.

Number    You are being asked to take part in this epidemiological research study at The  University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (hereinafter referred to as “M.D.  Anderson”). This consent form explains why we are performing this research study  and what your role will be if you choose to participate. This form also describes the  possible risks connected with being in this study. After reviewing this information with  the person responsible for your enrollment, you should know enough to be able to  make an informed decision on whether you want to participate in the study.    You are being asked to take part in this study as a case subject because you may have  been diagnosed with skin cancer (i.e. basal cell carcinoma [BCC], squamous cell skin  carcinoma [SCC], or melanoma) or you are being asked to participate as a control subject  because you do not have cancer.    DESCRIPTION OF RESEARCH    2. PURPOSE OF STUDY: The goal of this research study is to identify certain genetic  factors such as DNA repair genes and their biological functions that may play a role in  the outcome of skin cancers or how the disease affects patients so that individuals at  high risk could be identified and targeted for prevention. There will be no restriction on  age, sex, and ethnicity.    3. DESCRIPTION OF RESEARCH: For case subject: As part of your diagnosis and/or  treatment plan, you will have a biopsy and/or surgical procedure done by your doctor  at M.D. Anderson or at another institution.  Any remaining tissue not required for  diagnosis may be used for this study.  Some of the tissue may be obtained from  procedures you have had performed at another institution.    Also for this study, you will have around 3-4 tablespoons of blood drawn from a vein in  the arm. This blood will be used for special genetic tests, and will be frozen and stored  for use in future research.    Protocol LAB03-0048  Revised June 23 2008  Page 2 of 7      You will not be contacted with the results of any tests performed for this study.    You will also be asked to complete a lifestyle questionnaire that includes questions  about your diet, family history, and lifestyle factors such as sunlight exposure. It  should take around 45-50 minutes to complete the questionnaire. If you cannot  complete the questionnaire during a visit to M.D. Anderson, you may take the  questionnaire home and return it by mail. You will be given a prepaid envelope to  return the questionnaire.    This is an investigational study. Up to 6,000 participants will take part in this study.  3,000 case subjects (about 500 BCC, 500 SCC and 2,000 melanoma), and 3,000  control subjects. All will be enrolled at M.D. Anderson. There is no cost to the  participant for participation in this study.    4. RISKS, SIDE EFFECTS, AND DISCOMFORTS TO PARTICIPANTS:    For case subjects, since the tissue sample will be collected after a routine procedure  that will be performed as part of your standard of care, no additional risks are  expected.    • Blood draw: You may experience pain, bleeding, and/or bruising from the blood  draws. You may faint and/or develop an infection with redness and irritation of the vein  at the site where blood is drawn. Frequent blood collection may cause anemia (low  red blood cell count), which may create a need for blood transfusions.    • Emotional distress: Some questions in the questionnaire may be sensitive in  nature. You may refuse to answer any question that makes you feel uncomfortable. If  you have concerns after completing this questionnaire, you are encouraged to contact  your physician or the study chair.    M.D. Anderson and others can learn about cancer and other diseases from your  tissue, blood, and bodily fluids. Reports about such research done with these  sample(s) will not be given to you or your doctor, and these reports will not be put in  your health records. In the future, people who do research with these sample(s) may  need to know more information about your health that can be learned from your  medical record. M.D. Anderson will make reasonable efforts to preserve your privacy  but cannot ensure complete privacy.  Sometimes tissue, blood, or other bodily fluids  may be used for genetic research (about diseases that are passed on in families).  Even if the sample(s) were used for this kind of research, the results would not be put  in your health records. Research with tissue, blood, or other bodily fluids may result in  the development of beneficial treatments, devices, new drugs, or patentable  procedures, from which you will not receive any financial benefits or compensation.    This research study may involve unpredictable risks to the participants.      Protocol LAB03-0048  Revised June 23 2008  Page 3 of 7      5. POTENTIAL BENEFITS: The identification of factors that increase a person’s risk of  developing cancers has the potential to benefit many. There are no benefits for you in  participating in this study. Future individuals may benefit from what is learned.    6. ALTERNATE PROCEDURES OR TREATMENTS: You may choose not to take part  in this study.    7. This protocol is partially funded by research grants from the National Institutes of  Health (NIH).     I understand that the following statements about this study are true:    8. As required by the M. D. Anderson conflict of interest policy, a faculty member may  not serve as the study chair for a study or primary physician for a subject on a study if  he, she, or a family member holds any equity interest in the company sponsoring the  study or has received cash in excess of $10,000 within the previous 12-month period  from the company.    9. In some instances of medical emergency, it is possible that I may be cared for by a  physician and/or administrator who have some form of equity, stock option, or other  interest in the sponsor or supporter of this study. If I want to receive updated  information regarding the financial interests of any physician or M. D. Anderson  personnel who has cared for me, I may call the Conflict of Interest Coordinator at 713- 792-3220.  Upon request, I will be given access to information that will let me know if  the UT System or M. D.

UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO (UCSF)  ASSENT TO BE IN A RESEARCH STUDY ABOUT CANCER TREATMENT  For children 7-12 years old  Why are we meeting with you?  We want to tell you about something we are doing called a research study.  A research study is when doctors collect a lot of information to learn more about something.  Dr. [PI's name] and some other doctors are doing a study to learn more about children with cancer.  After we tell you about it, we will ask if you'd like to be in this study or not.  Why are we doing this study?  We want to find out how well your kind of cancer treatment is working.  So we are getting information from lots of boys and girls like you.  In the whole study, there will be about 300 children who have brain tumors.  What will happen to you if you are in this study?  Only if you agree, two things will happen:  1. A small amount of your blood will be drawn.  That means it will be taken by a needle in your arm.  This will happen every 3 months for one year.  [If some or all of blood draws would be done anyway as part of child's clinical care, emphasize here what will be done extra for the study.]  2. The doctors will do some tests on part of your brain tumor.  The part they look at will already be removed before the study begins.  Will this study hurt?  The stick from the needle to draw your blood will hurt, but the hurt will go away after awhile.  It will not hurt for the doctors to look at the part of your brain tumor that's already been removed.  Will you get better if you are in this study?  No, this study won't make you feel better or get well.  But the doctors might find out something that will help other children like you later.  Do you have any questions?  You can ask questions any time.  You can ask now.  You can ask later.  You can talk to me or you can talk to someone else.  Do you have to be in this study?  No, you don't.  No one will be mad at you if you don't want to do this.  If you don't want to be in this study, just tell us.  Or if you do want to be in the study, tell us that.  And, remember, you can say yes now and change your mind later.  It's up to you.  If you don't want to be in this study, just tell us.  If you want to be in this study, just tell us.

There are three requirements to be a part of this project:  1) You are at least 18 years old. 2) You receive your medical care from Marshfield Clinic. 3) You either live in one of 19 Zip code areas in central Wisconsin chosen for this project OR you have a health problem that is being studied  Research is being done to learn how diseases develop.  Many common diseases may be passed down in families.  They may be passed down through our genes. Genes are made up of DNA.  DNA is found in all of the cells in your body, including your white blood cells and the cells from your cheek.  These are the types of cells we use in our research.  DNA is made up of chemicals that are arranged in a specific order, or sequence.  Even small differences in genes may play a role in the development of disease and its response to treatment.  For example, some people have bad side effects after taking some drugs.  Others do not have any side effects.  Disease can also be influenced by the environment in which we live or by our personal behaviors, such as diet.  The main goal of this project is to apply genetic science to human health.  The project will try to do this by creating a Personalized Medicine Research Database.  The purpose of this database will be to store questiomlaire, genetic and medical record information.  Many researchers will use this database.  Some researchers will try to learn what genes cause common diseases and to find out which genes predict reactions to drugs.  Other researchers could examine how the environment and genetic factors work together to cause disease.  We hope all this information will help us learn to predict the development of disease and responses to drugs.  If we can predict disease, we may be better able to prevent or treat disease.  Many subjects will be in this research project.  The goal is to have at least 40,000 people enroll in this project.  We plan to continue this project indefinitely.  We will continue to add to the research database indefinitely. This will allow the researchers to follow the health of a large group of people in Central Wisconsin.  Date Approved - October 28, 2013    Consent Form CAL1O1O2+PM-C -  Main Consent Page 2 of 6  You will not get direct benefit from this project.  You will not receive any direct medical benefit for being in this project. You may feel good being a part of research that could help medical science. A possible gain to you would be if new tests or therapies become part of medical practice and physicians make use of that new knowledge when caring for patients.  You will be paid for taking part in the project.  You will receive twenty dollars ($20) for being a part of this project. If you return a completed Diet History Questiomlaire you will receive an additional ten dollars ($10).  A number of things will happen if you agree to take part in the project.  We will ask you to fill out a questiomlaire.   This will give us information about yourself and your enviromnent.  The family information you give will be coded to show fatuity relationships among the people taking part in the project.  We will measure your height and weight. We will also measure and record your blood pressure.  A Marshfield Clinic staff member will draw some blood.   About 5 tablespoons of blood will be collected.  If a blood sample is not possible, a cheek swab or saliva (spit) sample will be used instead. The DNA, or genetic part, will be taken from your sample, and will be stored.  The plasma and serum from your blood sample (if available) will be stored separately.  We will link information about your DNA, plasma, and serum with selected information from your medical records and other medical samples.  Other medical samples could include pathology samples or blood left from lab tests.  These samples may have already been collected or may be collected in the future.  We will put this information into a research database.  Research staff will have access to your medical record. Selected information from your medical record will be put into the research database. This will continue throughout the proJ'ect.  You will receive a copy of your signed consent form.  We will protect your privacy and keep your genetic, medical, and other personal information confidential. We will not put information into your medical record.  Your DNA information will not be used for medical care~  We will not release it to employers or insurance companies.  We will treat all records and materials that identify you as confidential.  We have a Certificate of Confidentiality from the National Institutes of Health.  This helps us to protect your privacy.  Researchers can not be forced to give out information that could identify you in any court matter. While not likely, government officials could try to use this information.  The Certificate has not been tested in courts.  This Certificate will not prevent necessary auditing or evaluation~  We would still need to disclose information that is required by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  We will code all information entered into the database.    We will not use your name, date of birtll, phone, medical history or social security number as part of this code.  For each study using the repository, research staff members that see your identifiable medical record information will not be able to see identifiable genetic information and vice versa.  People we share research data with will see only coded information.  They will not be able to identify you.  Date Approved - October 28, 2013    Consent Form CALIO1O2+PM-C - Main Consent Page 3 of 6   There is a federal law called the HIPAA Privacy Rule. It requires us to keep your medical information private and confidential. Some researchers we share information with may not be required to follow this federal law. In Wisconsin there is a state law that requires us to keep medical information confidential. We may share information with researchers in states with different state laws. While we work with other researchers that are very professional alld are also concerned about confidentiality, we camlot guarantee they are required to follow the same rules.  Another federal law is called The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) of 2008. This law will protect you against discrimination when you apply for health insurance or employment. GINA will not protect you from discrimination if you apply for other types of insurance. Wisconsin laws also prohibit discrimination based on genetic testing. But the laws do not apply to all types of genetic information. These laws can be hard to enforce. The Marshfield Clinic has a policy that does not allow discrimination in health care based on genetics. If you take part in this research, you would have no genetic information to relay to an employer, insurance company or other inquiring third party.  We will keep the Personalized Medicine Research Database on a secure computer system. It will not connect to any external network, such as the Internet.  The computer is in a secure location.  A limited number of approved researchers and staff have access to the database.  Only a few individuals will have access to the codes that link your identity to the data.  Approved researchers and staff will have access to your research data.  Research studies using the database are reviewed. One review is to make sure the studies have scientific value. Another review is done by the Institutional Review Board (IRB). This review makes sure participants are informed and their rights are protected. If deemed necessary, you may be re-contacted for your consent to allow your samples to be used for a specific project.  If you join PMRP, approved Marshfield Clinic research staff will have access to your medical records, in addition to study related data and samples.  These data and samples may be shared with trusted research partners outside of the Marshfield Clinic system.  In order to minimize the risk of unintended release of information, shared data and samples will be stripped of all identifiers except for a study code to permit tracking.  Databases are being developed to help further medical research.  We will share coded data with these types of databases.  One example of this type of database is called ""dbGaP"" (short for ""Database Genotype and ~Phenotype"").  This database has been set up by the National Institutes of Health.  The Marshfield Clinic Research Foundation's Institutional Review Board could review this research project. They may see sections of research records with your name or other identifiers. We may be required to provide summary information to workers or contractors of the United States Government for reviewing or evaluating Federally-funded projects. They are required by law to keep the information private.  Researchers may present findings at scientific meetings and in scientific publications. You will never be identified in either of these.  Though unlikely, there are possible risks and discomforts of the project. Having blood taken from a vein may result in minor pain and slight bruising. There is a small chance of infection at the site where the blood was drawn. Some people might faint when their blood is drawn.  Date Approved - October 28, 2013    Consent Form CAL1O1O2+PM-C F Main Consent Page 4 of 6  There is a very small chance your personal information could become known to you, your doctor, or others.  If research results are released by mistake it may cause you some distress.  You could be treated differently.  It may cause psychological or social problems for you.  This information could also affect family relationships. These risks are very low because we are careful about protecting research information.  This consent form describes the known risks of research in which DNA samples are used. There may also be risks we have not foreseen.  There is no cost to you for taking part in this project.  Neither you nor your insurance company will get a billed for study- related procedures.  Emergency care and compensation for injury.  If you become ill or injured from this study, medical care is available at Marshfield Clinic, St. Joseph's Hospital or other medical facilities. You or your health insurer would be responsible for this cost. This facility has no plans to compensate you for such illness or injury, financially or otherwise.  Commercial products, patents or licenses may be developed as a result of this project. All samples, data and research findings will belong to The Marshfield Clinic. However, we may work with other institutions or companies to develop commercial products, patents or licenses. If these are developed, there are no plans to share profits with you. We will put any profits back into the Marshfield Clinic system. We will use the money for healthcare, education and research.  Your relationship with your doctors or this facility remains the same.  If you choose not to participate, your relationship with your doctors or with the Marshfield Clinic will not change. This research project is completely voluntary. You will not lose benefits to which you would otherwise be entitled. The decision will not affect your future medical care at the Marshfield Clinic. The same holds true if you decide to withdraw.  You can withdraw from this project at any time.  You have the right to withdraw from this study at any time.  If you withdraw, we will destroy your remaining DNA, plasma and serum.  We will not use your information in future studies.  If your samples have already been used in research it would not be possible to remove any of the information that may have been learned prior to your request to withdraw.  We will document your decision on a form, and ask you to sign the form. If you wish to withdraw please call us at 715-389-7733 or 1-888-334-2232.  Your relatives will not be contacted because of information you gave us. Relatives will not be contacted because you gave us their names.

UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO ASSENT TO BE IN A RESEARCH STUDY  Study Title: ACTG 273, Version 1.0: A Phase I/II Study of HIVIG in Slowing Progression of Disease in HIV-Infected Children  What is this study about?  Diane Whittle, M.D., and Alejandro Solis, M.D., from the Department of Pediatrics, are doing a research study.  A research study is when doctors collect a lot of information to learn more about something.  This study is to find out if a medicine called HIVIG is safe for treating children with HIV.  Because you are infected with HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus), the doctors are asking you if you want to be in this study.  What will happen to you if you are in this study?  1. First, the study doctor will ask you questions about your health.  You will have a physical exam, and you will give some urine and some blood for testing.  2. Then, if you are going to stay in the study, you will get HIVIG.  The HIVIG medicine will be given through a needle in your arm.  3. During the 9 months of the study, you will need to visit the clinic at least 19 times for physical exams and blood tests.  Each visit will last 1 to 7 hours.  [If some or all of exams/blood draws would be done anyway as part of child's clinical care, emphasize what will be done extra for the study.]  4. You will be given HIVIG 6 times, about once a month.  Will any parts of the study hurt?  It may hurt when a needle is put in your arm to take blood or to give you the HIVIG.  The doctors will ask you if you want a numbing medicine on your skin to try and make it hurt less.  Will you get better if you are in this study?  You may get a little better by being this study or you may stay healthier for a longer time, but we don't know if that will happen.  The doctors don't think that the HIVIG will make your HIV infection go away completely.  What if you have questions?  You can ask Dr. Whittle, Dr. Solis, or the nurses who work them any questions you have about the study.  You can ask your questions now or later, any time you like. You can also ask your parents to ask questions for you.  What are your choices?  If your parents agree, you can be in this study if you want to, but you don't have to be in it if you don't want to.  No one will get mad at you if you don't want to do this. If you decide to be in this study now and you change your mind later, that's okay, too.  You just have to tell the doctors.  If you don't want to be in this study, just tell us.  If you want to be in this study, just tell us.

2019-05-13,../data//PMBB Informed Consent (2),../data//PMBB Informed Consent (2).txt,"  PENN Medicine BioBank:  Tissue    UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA  RESEARCH SUBJECT INFORMED CONSENT AND  HIPAA AUTHORIZATION FORM    Protocol Title: Penn Medicine BioBank: Tissue and/or Blood Collection  Principal Michael D. Feldman, MD, PhD  Investigator: University of Pennsylvania  (215) 662-6503  Secondary JoEllen Weaver  Contact: University of Pennsylvania  (215) 349-5027    Researchers are trying to learn more about cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and other health  problems. Much of this research is done using human tissue and blood. Through these studies,  researchers hope to find new ways to detect, treat, and maybe prevent or cure health problems.  Some of these studies may be about how genes affect health and disease, or how genes affect  response to treatment. Some of them may lead to new products, such as drugs or tests for  diseases.  We are asking you to let us store some of your health information along with your tissue and/or  blood to use in these kinds of studies. Tissue donated would be in excess of what is needed for  your health care. Any adult who gets care at Penn Medicine may be asked to donate to this  BioBank. We plan to collect samples on approximately 10,000 patients over the next 5 years.  You can choose to take part in this storage project or not. This consent form gives information to  help you decide. This form includes the HIPAA Authorization describing your confidentiality and  privacy rights. Please read it carefully and take all the time you need to make your choice. Be  sure to ask us as many questions as you want. Everyone who takes part in research should know  that:  • Taking part may involve some risks.  • Taking part is voluntary. If you choose to take part, you can quit at any time.  • No matter what you decide, now or in the future, it will not affect your medical care.  WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS RESEARCH PROJECT?  The purpose of the Penn Medicine BioBank is to collect and store tissue, blood, and health  information so researchers can use them in future studies.  Your donated sample may be used in a variety of research studies including basic medical,  translational, clinical, and epidemiological research.  Some of these studies will use your DNA. Human DNA is organized in pieces called genes that  provide the instructions to make our bodies work. Common diseases may be caused by several  genes that work together. Also, your sample may be used for the measurement of markers that  associate with disease or development of diseases. Some researchers might study the link of  DNA and other blood markers with clinical outcomes, including response to treatment.  Other studies may involve creating cell lines from your donated sample. These cells will be  similar or identical to you genetically. Cell lines may be kept for many years and may be used  to develop treatments for a variety of diseases and conditions.   Version 1.2 – 7/22/13 Page 1 of 5  IRB Approval From 3/19/15 to 3/18/16    PENN Medicine BioBank:  Tissue    WHAT IS INVOLVED?  Your participation will take approximately 15-20 minutes of your time. If you agree to take part,  we will ask you to sign this form. We will give you a copy to keep. Here is what will happen next:  1. If you consent to donate tissue, the tissue sample would be a portion of the tissue  normally removed for your care.  During your time at UPHS, any time that tissue is  removed as part of your care, the removed tissue may be examined in the Department  of Pathology. The Department of Pathology will determine the amount of  tissue needed  for your health care. If you consent, tissue in excess of this amount may be released to  the BioBank. If you do not consent to donate this tissue, excess tissue will be destroyed.  2. If you consent to donate blood, we will get a blood sample from you. We will collect up to  3 tablespoons of blood from a vein in your arm. This blood collection may be done in  combination with other clinical procedures, or an additional needle stick.  3. W e will get some information about you and your health.  • We will ask you to provide some identifying information, such as your name, date of  birth, medical record number and contact information.  • We will ask you for some additional information about you, such as your race, health  history and family’s health conditions.  • We will get some health information from your medical record, examples include test  results, medical procedures, images (such as X-rays), and medicines you take.  • We will use your medical record from time to time to update this information.  4. W e will store your sample and information in the BioBank, along with those from all the  other people who take part. There is no limit on the length of time we will keep it. Your  sample and data may be kept until they are used up, or until the Penn Medicine BioBank  decides to destroy them.  5. W e will let researchers use the materials stored in the BioBank for approved studies.  Researchers from Penn, other universities, the government, and drug- or health-related  companies can apply to use the materials. A science committee at the BioBank will review  each request. There will also be an ethics review.  6. Some of your genetic and health information may be placed in scientific databases,  along with that from many other people. Information that could directly identify you will  never be included. Researchers who want to study the information must apply to the  database.  WHAT ARE THE POSSIBLE RISKS?  Because the tissue being removed is part of your care, there is no additional risk to donating  tissue.  The most common risks related to drawing blood from your arm are brief pain and/or bruising.  There is a risk that someone could get access to the data we have stored about you. In some  cases, it could be used to make it harder for you to get or keep a job or insurance. There are laws  against the misuse of genetic information, but they may not give full protection. W e believe the  chance these things will happen is very small, but we cannot make guarantees.  There is a risk that someone could trace the information in a scientific database back to you.   Even without your name or other identifiers, your genetic information is unique to you. We believe  the chance that someone will identify you is very small. But the risk may grow in the future if  people come up with new ways of tracing information.   Version 1.2 – 7/22/13 Page 2 of 5  IRB Approval From 3/19/15 to 3/18/16    PENN Medicine BioBank:  Tissue    WHAT PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION DO RESEARCHERS WANT TO USE?  The researchers may want to use portions of your health information that they will need for their  research. If you enter the Penn Medicine BioBank, health information that may be used and/or  released include the following:  • Name  • Medical record number  • Dates such as date of birth, medical events, and follow-up  • Address, telephone number  • Tissue/blood/cells/DNA  WHY IS MY PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION NEEDED?  Your information is used by the research team to:  • Do the research  • Oversee the research  • To see if the research was done right  WHO WILL BE ABLE TO SEE MY PERSONAL HEALTH INFORMATION?

contact: university of pennsylvania (215) 349-5027 researchers are trying to learn more about cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and other health problems. much of this research is done using human tissue and blood. through these studies, researchers hope to find new ways to detect, treat, and maybe prevent or cure health problems. some of these studies may be about how genes affect health and disease, or how genes affect response to treatment. some of them may lead to new products, such as drugs or tests for diseases. we are asking you to let us store some of your health information along with your tissue and/or blood to use in these kinds of studies. tissue donated would be in excess of what is needed for your health care. any adult who gets care at penn medicine may be asked to donate to this biobank. we plan to collect samples on approximately 10,000 patients over the next 5 years. you can choose to take part in this storage project or not. this consent form gives information to help you decide. this form includes the hipaa authorization describing your confidentiality and privacy rights. please read it carefully and take all the time you need to make your choice. be sure to ask us as many questions as you want. everyone who takes part in research should know that: taking part may involve some risks. taking part is voluntary. if you choose to take part, you can quit at any time. no matter what you decide, now or in the future, it will not affect your medical care. what is the purpose of this research project the purpose of the penn medicine biobank is to collect and store tissue, blood, and health information so researchers can use them in future studies. your donated sample may be used in a variety of research studies including basic medical, translational, clinical, and epidemiological research. some of these studies will use your dna. human dna is organized in pieces called genes that provide the instructions to make our bodies work. common diseases may be caused by several genes that work together. also, your sample may be used for the measurement of markers that associate with disease or development of diseases. some researchers might study the link of dna and other blood markers with clinical outcomes, including response to treatment. other studies may involve creating cell lines from your donated sample. these cells will be similar or identical to you genetically. cell lines may be kept for many years and may be used to develop treatments for a variety of diseases and conditions. version 1.2 7/22/13 page 1 of 5 irb approval from 3/19/15 to 3/18/16 penn medicine biobank: tissue what is involved your participation will take approximately 15-20 minutes of your time. if you agree to take part, we will ask you to sign this form. we will give you a copy to keep. here is what will happen next: 1. if you consent to donate tissue, the tissue sample would be a portion of the tissue normally removed for your care. during your time at uphs, any time that tissue is removed as part of your care, the removed tissue may be examined in the department of pathology. the department of pathology will determine the amount of tissue needed for your health care. if you consent, tissue in excess of this amount may be released to the biobank. if you do not consent to donate this tissue, excess tissue will be destroyed. 2. if you consent to donate blood, we will get a blood sample from you. we will collect up to 3 tablespoons of blood from a vein in your arm. this blood collection may be done in combination with other clinical procedures, or an additional needle stick. 3. w e will get some information about you and your health. we will ask you to provide some identifying information, such as your name, date of birth, medical record number and contact information. we will ask you for some additional information about you, such as your race, health history and family s health conditions. we will get some health information from your medical record, examples include test results, medical procedures, images (such as x-rays), and medicines you take. we will use your medical record from time to time to update this information. 4. w e will store your sample and information in the biobank, along with those from all the other people who take part. there is no limit on the length of time we will keep it. your sample and data may be kept until they are used up, or until the penn medicine biobank decides to destroy them. 5. w e will let researchers use the materials stored in the biobank for approved studies. researchers from penn, other universities, the government, and drug- or health-related companies can apply to use the materials. a science committee at the biobank will review each request. there will also be an ethics review. 6. some of your genetic and health information may be placed in scientific databases, along with that from many other people. information that could directly identify you will never be included. researchers who want to study the information must apply to the database. what are the possible risks because the tissue being removed is part of your care, there is no additional risk to donating tissue. the most common risks related to drawing blood from your arm are brief pain and/or bruising. there is a risk that someone could get access to the data we have stored about you. in some cases, it could be used to make it harder for you to get or keep a job or insurance. there are laws against the misuse of genetic information, but they may not give full protection. w e believe the chance these things will happen is very small, but we cannot make guarantees. there is a risk that someone could trace the information in a scientific database back to you. even without your name or other identifiers, your genetic information is unique to you. we believe the chance that someone will identify you is very small. but the risk may grow in the future if people come up with new ways of tracing information. version 1.2 7/22/13 page 2 of 5 irb approval from 3/19/15 to 3/18/16 penn medicine biobank: tissue what protected health information do

Example: Phase II study ...find out what effects, good and/or bad, [study drug/intervention] has on you and your [specify type/stage/presentation of] cancer.  Example: Phase III study ...compare the effects, good and/or bad, of [study drug/intervention] with [commonly used drug/ intervention] on you and your [specify type/stage/presentation of] cancer to find out which is better.  In this study, you will get either the [study drug/intervention] or the [commonly used drug/ intervention].  You will not get both.]  [Address sponsorship and financial interests here:  * The IRB requires that all consent forms disclose which agencies or institutions (e.g., National Institutes of Health, Department of Defense, Center for Disease Control, State agencies), cooperative groups (CALGB, COG, ACTG), foundations or industry sponsors are funding the research or providing study drugs or equipment for the study. If the study is not being funded by an external agency, then the internal funding source, i.e., Department funds, personal funds, should be identified. This information should be included either in the section headed Why is this study being done? (Purpose and Background) or in a section headed Who pays for this study?  * Investigators must also disclose the nature of any financial or proprietary interests, though this disclosure can be in general terms. For suggested wording, see Conflicts of Interest in Research.  [Any investigational drug(s) or device(s) to be used in the study should be noted and named. The name by which the drug or device is referred to in this section should be used consistently throughout the form.]  How many people will take part in this study?  About [state total accrual goal here] people will take part in this study.  [If appropriate, give a short description about cohorts here.  For example: ""At the beginning of the study, [state number of first cohort] patients will be treated with a low dose of the drug.  If this dose does not cause bad side effects, it will slowly be made higher as new patients take part in the study.  You can ask your study doctor what dose you will receive.  A total of [state maximum number] of patients is the most that would be able to enter the study.""  For multi-center studies, it is good to give figures both for the whole study and for local enrollment at UCSF.]  What will happen if I take part in this research study?  [List tests and procedures and their frequency under the categories below.  Indicate whether the subject will be at home, in the hospital, in an outpatient or other setting.  See examples below.] Before you begin the main part of the study... You will need to have the following exams, tests or procedures to find out if you can be in the main part of the study. These exams, tests or procedures are part of regular cancer care and may be done even if you do not join the study. If you have had some of them recently, they may not need to be repeated. This will be up to your study doctor. * [List tests and procedures as appropriate. Use bulleted format.]  During the main part of the study... If the exams, tests and procedures show that you can be in the main part of the study, and you choose to take part, then you will need the following tests and procedures.

Define the length of follow-up.] * Study location: All study procedures will be done at . . .[If different procedures will take place at different locations, specify accordingly]. [If appropriate to the study, include the following additional procedure statement(s) using IRB wording:] * Placebo:  Define as ""an inactive substance.""  * Blood drawing (venipuncture):  [Once a week,] a blood sample will be drawn by inserting a needle into a vein in your arm.  Each sample will be approximately [XX] teaspoons; a total of about [XX] tablespoons will be drawn for the whole study.  * X-ray:  You will have an x-ray of your [lungs, done once at the beginning of the study, and again at the end of the study,] in order to check . . . Each x-ray will take about [XX hour(s)].  * CT scan:  You will have a computed tomography (CT) [/computerized axial tomography (CAT)] scan of your [XXX], done[XXX], in order to check . . . A CT scan uses special x-ray equipment to make detailed pictures of body tissues and organs.  For the CT scan, you will need to lie still on a table with your [XXX] inside a large doughnut-shaped machine.  The table will move and the machine will make clicking and whirring noises as the pictures are taken.  [If appropriate: An iodine dye (contrast material) will first be [injected into a vein/given to you orally/rectally].  The dye makes tissue and organs more visible in the pictures.]  Each CT scan will take about 15 minutes to a half hour.  * MRI: [Once every two weeks,] you will have a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) exam.  For the MRI exam, you will lie down on a narrow bed that will then be placed in a tunnel that is 6 feet long by 22 inches wide and open at each end.  You will need to lie there quietly for about one hour, during which time there will be a loud banging noise.  You may feel warm during this procedure. [If appropriate: Gadolinium (contrast material) will first be [injected into a vein in your arm].  The dye makes tissue and organs more visible in the MRI.]  [Optional Feature: In addition to the mandatory narrative explanation of study procedures as above, a simplified calendar (study chart) or schema (study plan) may be inserted here.  The schema from the protocol is too complex, but use of a simplified version of the schema is encouraged.  Instructions for reading the calendar or schema should be included. See examples.] Study Chart [Example] You will receive [drugs or interventions] every [insert appropriate number of days or weeks] in this study. This [insert number of days or weeks] period of time is called a cycle. The cycle will be repeated [insert number] times. Each cycle is numbered in order. The chart below shows what will happen to you during Cycle 1 and future treatment cycles. The left-hand column shows the day in the cycle and the right-hand column tells you what to do on that day. Cycle 1 Day  What you do Two days before starting study treatment * Get routine blood tests. Day before starting study treatment * Check-in to _____________ the evening before starting study. Day 1 of treatment * Begin taking _____________once a day. Keep taking ____________ 	until the end of study, unless told to stop by your health care team. Day 2 * Leave _______________ and go to where you are staying. Day 8 * Get routine blood tests. Day 15 * Get routine blood tests. Day 22 * Get routine blood tests. Day 28 * Get routine blood tests and exams.  * Get 2nd chest x-ray for research purposes. Day 29  * Return to your doctor's office at _______ [insert appointment time] 	for your next exam and to begin the next cycle. Future cycles Day What you do Days 1-28 * Keep taking _____ once a day if you have no bad side effects and [condition] is 	not getting worse.  Call the doctor at _____________ [insert phone number] if 	you do not know what to do. * Get routine blood tests each week (more if your doctor tells you to).  * Get routine blood tests and exams every cycle (more if your doctor tells you to).  * Get routine X-rays, CT scans, or MRIs every other cycle (more if your doctor 	tells you to).  Day 29 * Return to your doctor's office at _______ [insert appointment time] for your 	next exam and to begin the next cycle. Study Plan [Example] Another way to find out what will happen to you during the study is to read the chart below. Start reading at the top and read down the list, following the lines and arrows. Start Here  Breast Cancer Surgery  Medicines Used in This Study Doxorubicin + Cyclophosphamide given by vein once every 21 days and repeated 4 times  Randomize (You will be in Group 1 or Group 2)  Group 1 Paclitaxel by vein Every 21 days for 4 visits        Group 2 No Paclitaxel                                     How long will I be in the study? You will be asked to take [drugs or interventions] for [months, weeks/until a certain event]. After you are finished taking [drugs or interventions], the study doctor will ask you to visit the office for follow-up exams for at least [indicate time frames and requirements of follow-up. When appropriate, state that the study will involve long-term follow-up and specify time frames and requirements of long-term follow-up. For example, ""We would like to keep track of your medical condition for the rest of your life. We would like to do this by calling you on the telephone once a year to see how you are doing. Keeping in touch with you and checking on your condition every year helps us look at the long-term effects of the study.""] Can I stop being in the study? Yes. You can decide to stop at any time. Tell the study doctor if you are thinking about stopping or decide to stop. He or she will tell you how to stop your participation safely.  It is important to tell the study doctor if you are thinking about stopping so any risks from the [drugs or interventions] can be evaluated by your doctor. Another reason to tell your doctor that you are thinking about stopping is to discuss what follow-up care and testing could be most helpful for you. The study doctor may stop you from taking part in this study at any time if he/she believes it is in your best interest, if you do not follow the study rules, or if the study is stopped. What side effects or risks can I expect from being in the study? You may have side effects while on the study. Everyone taking part in the study will be watched carefully for any side effects. However, doctors don't know all the side effects that may happen.  Side effects may be mild or very serious. Your health care team may give you medicines to help lessen side effects. Many side effects go away soon after you stop taking the [drugs or interventions]. In some cases, side effects can be serious, long lasting, or may never go away. [The next sentence should be included if appropriate: There also is a risk of death.]  You should talk to your study doctor about any side effects you experience while taking part in the study. Risks and side effects related to the [procedures, drugs, interventions, devices] include those which are: Likely *  *  *  Less Likely  *  *  *  Rare but serious *  *  *  [Notes for consent form authors regarding the presentation of risks and side effects: * Using a bulleted format, list risks and side effects related to the investigational aspects of the trial.  Do not list side effects of supportive medications unless the medications are specifically mandated by the study. * List by regimen the physical and nonphysical risks and side effects of participating in the study in three categories: 1. ""likely""; 2. ""less likely""; 3. ""rare but serious.""  * There is no standard definition of ""likely"" and ""less likely.""  As a guideline, ""likely"" can be viewed as occurring in greater than 20% of patients and ""less likely"" in less than or equal to 20% of patients.  However, this categorization should be adapted to specific study agents by the principal investigator. * In the ""likely"" and ""less likely"" categories, identify those side effects that may be ""serious.""  ""Serious"" is defined as side effects that may require hospitalization or may be irreversible, long-term, life threatening or fatal.  * Side effects that occur in less than 2-3% of patients do not have to be listed unless they are serious, and should then appear in the ""rare but serious"" category. * Physical and non-physical risks and side effects should include such things as the inability to work.  Whenever possible, describe side effects by how they make a patient feel, for example, ""Loss of red blood cells, also called anemia, can cause tiredness, weakness and shortness of breath.""  * For some investigational drugs/ interventions/ devices there may be side effects that have been noted during treatment, but not enough data is available to determine if the side effect is related to the drug/ intervention/ device. Inclusion of this information in the informed consent document is not mandatory, but it may be prudent to mention the most serious effects. If included, these side effects should be listed under a separate category titled ""Side effects reported by patients, but not proven to be caused by [drug/ intervention/ device].""  Side effects in this category do not have to be labeled as ""likely,"" ""less likely,"" or ""rare but serious"" and should not be repeated here if they appear in a previous category.  Similar to the other categories, these side effects should be listed in a bulleted format.] [If appropriate to the study, include the following risk statement(s) using IRB wording:] * Randomization risks:  You will be assigned to a treatment program by chance, and the treatment you receive may prove to be less effective or to have more side effects than the other study treatment(s) or other available treatments. * Placebo risks:  If you are in the group that receives placebo, your condition will go without the active (study) treatment for [XX weeks].  * Blood drawing (venipuncture) risks:  Drawing blood may cause temporary discomfort from the needle stick, bruising, infection, and fainting.  * Radiation risks: [Include one of the three paragraphs below if your study involves radiation. The paragraph you include will depend on the total effective dose from all treatments used, regardless of whether they are standard of care or experimental. Studies in which patients will receive different total effective doses should either use the maximum possible dose that a patient could receive or use multiple consent forms. IN NO INSTANCE SHOULD A PATIENT RECEIVE MORE RADIATION THAN THE MAXIMUM STATED ON THE CONSENT FORM.]  Total Effective Dose of <3 mSv This research study involves exposure to radiation from [type of procedure].  This radiation exposure is not necessary for your medical care and is for research purposes only.  The additional amount of radiation that you will receive as a result of participating in this study will be less than the yearly natural background radiation in the US (3 mSv).  The use of radiation involves minimal risk and is required to obtain the desired research information. If you are pregnant or breast feeding, you SHOULD NOT participate in this study.  If you have any questions regarding the use of radiation or the risks involved, please consult the physician conducting the study.  Effective Dose of 3 to 50 mSv This research study involves exposure to radiation from [type of procedure].  This radiation exposure is not necessary for your medical care and is for research purposes only.  The additional amount of radiation that you will receive as a result of participating in this study will be a maximum of approximately [insert amount] mSv, which is equivalent to [insert amount] the yearly natural background of radiation in the US (3 mSv).  The use of radiation may involve a low risk of cancer and is required to obtain the desired research information. If you are pregnant or breast feeding, you SHOULD NOT participate in this study.  If you have any questions regarding the use of radiation or the risks involved, please consult the physician conducting the study.  Effective Dose of >50 mSv This research study involves exposure to radiation as part of the protocol.  This radiation exposure is not necessary for your medical care and is for research purposes only. The additional amount of radiation that you will receive as a result of participating in this study will be a maximum of approximately [insert amount] mSv, which is equivalent to [insert amount] the yearly natural background of radiation in the US (3 mSv).  The use of radiation in this research study involves a low risk of cancer.  However, the UCSF Radiation Safety Committee has reviewed the use of radiation in this research study and has designated this use as acceptable to obtain the benefits provided by the results of the study.  If you are pregnant or breast feeding, you SHOULD NOT participate in this study.  If you have any questions regarding the use of radiation or the risks involved, please consult the physician conducting the study.  Radiation Therapy: [For situations involving radiation therapy, special risk language should be developed on a case-specific basis with the Radiation Safety Committee. Doses to individual organs should always be discussed, but the use of Effective Dose and comparison to background exposures is not appropriate.]  * CT scan risks:  CT scans involve the risks of radiation (see above).  In addition, if contrast material (iodine dye) is used, there is a slight risk of developing an allergic reaction, from mild (itching, rash) to severe (difficulty breathing, shock, or rarely, death).  The contrast material may also cause kidney problems, especially if you are dehydrated or have poor kidney function.  The study doctors will ask you about any allergies or related conditions before the procedure.  If you have any of these problems, you may not be allowed to have a CT scan [/continue in the study].  Having a CT scan may mean some added discomfort for you.  In particular, you may be bothered by feelings of claustrophobia when placed inside the CT scanner, or by lying in one position for a long time.  If contrast material is used, you may feel discomfort when it is injected [/given by XXX].  You may feel warm and flushed and get a metallic taste in your mouth. Rarely, the contrast material may cause nausea, vomiting or a headache.  [List other risks as appropriate to the method by which contrast agent is administered]. [If sedation may be used, discuss risks of sedation here].  * MRI risks:  Because the MRI machine acts like a large magnet, it could move iron-containing objects in the MRI room during your examination, which in the process could possibly harm you.  Precautions have been taken to prevent such an event from happening; loose metal objects, like pocket knives or key chains, are not allowed in the MRI room.  If you have a piece of metal in your body, such as a fragment in your eye, aneurysm clips, ear implants, spinal nerve stimulators, or a pacemaker, you will not be allowed into the MRI room and cannot have an MRI.  Having an MRI may mean some added discomfort for you.  In particular, you may be bothered by feelings of claustrophobia and by the loud banging noise during the study.  Temporary hearing loss has been reported from this loud noise.  This is why you will be asked to wear earplugs.  At times during the test, you may be asked to not swallow for a while, which can be uncomfortable.  Because the risks to a fetus from MRI are unknown, pregnant women must not participate in this study.   [If appropriate, also discuss the risks of contrast agents and/or sedation here. For example:]   Contrast agent (gadolinium) risks: A few side effects of gadolinium injection such as mild headache, nausea, and local pain may occur. Rarely (less than 1% of the time) low blood pressure and lightheadedness occurs. This can be treated immediately with intravenous fluids. Very rarely (less than on in one thousand), patients are allergic to gadolinium. These effects are most commonly hives and itchy eyes, but more severe reactions have been seen which result in shortness of breath.  Patients with severe kidney disease sometimes have a bad reaction to gadolinium contrast. The condition is called nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF). It can cause skin to tighten or scar and can damage internal organs. Sometimes it can be life-threatening. There are no reports of NSF in patients with normal kidney function. Before you have a MRI scan requiring an injection of gadolinium contrast, you will have a blood test in order to check the function of your kidneys. Based on your medical history and the results of the test, a doctor will decide whether it is safe for you to undergo the MRI scans.  * Reproductive risks:  You should not become pregnant or father a baby while on this study because the drugs in this study can affect an unborn baby.  Women should not breastfeed a baby while on this study.  It is important to understand that you need to use birth control while on this study.  Check with your study doctor about what kind of birth control methods to use and how long to use them.  Some methods might not be approved for use in this study.  [Include a statement about possible sterility when appropriate.  For example, ""Some of the drugs used in the study may make you unable to have children in the future.""  If appropriate, include a statement in the section on procedures that pregnancy testing will be required.] * HIV testing risks: Being tested for HIV may cause anxiety regardless of the test results.  A positive test indicates that you have been infected with the HIV virus. If you test positive we will refer you to a source of medical care and treatment.  Receiving positive results may make you very upset.  If other people learn about your positive test results, you may face discrimination. If your test is negative, there is still the possibility that you could be infected with the HIV virus and test positive at some time in the future.   * Safe Handling of Medications:  Handling [insert name of medication] and having contact with any urine, feces or vomit from patients receiving [name of medication] may pose some risk to you and your caregivers.  To avoid exposure to [name of medication] and any associated risks, you and your family members/caregivers will be educated by a member of the study team on how to safely handle [name of medication], properly dispose of [name of medication], and how to clean products that may be contaminated with [name of medication].  [Always include the following risk statements:]  * Unknown Risks: The experimental treatments may have side effects that no one knows about yet.  The researchers will let you know if they learn anything that might make you change your mind about participating in the study.  * For more information about risks and side effects, ask your study doctor. Are there benefits to taking part in the study? [Explain possible benefits appropriate to the study, using IRB wording, e.g.:] [If subject is randomized:]  If you are in the group that receives [XXX] and it proves to treat your condition [more effectively/with fewer side effects than standard therapy/placebo], you may benefit from participating in the study, but this cannot be guaranteed. [Or if no direct benefit to the subject is anticipated:] There will be no direct benefit to you from participating in this study.  However, this study will help doctors learn more about [procedures/ drugs/ interventions/ devices], and it is hoped that this information will help in the treatment of future patients with [. . . /conditions like yours]. [For cancer studies, use the following wording:] Taking part in this study may or may not make your health better.  While doctors hope [procedures/ drugs/ interventions/ devices] will be more useful against cancer compared to the usual treatment, there is no proof of this.  We do know that the information from this study will help doctors learn more about [procedures/ drugs/ interventions/ devices] as a treatment for cancer.  This information could help future cancer patients. What other choices do I have if I do not take part in this study? Your other choices may include: * Getting treatment or care for your cancer without being in a study.  * Taking part in another study. * Getting no treatment. [Additional bullets should include, when appropriate, alternative specific procedures or treatments.] * [For studies involving end-stage cancer, add the following paragraph as an additional bullet: Getting comfort care, also called palliative care.  This type of care helps reduce pain, tiredness, appetite problems and other problems caused by the cancer.  It does not treat the cancer directly, but instead tries to improve how you feel.  Comfort care tries to keep you as active and comfortable as possible.] Please talk to your doctor about your choices before deciding if you will take part in this study. How will information about me be kept confidential?  Participation in research involves some loss of privacy.  We will do our best to make sure that information about you is kept confidential, but we cannot guarantee total privacy.  Some information from your medical records will be collected and used for this study.  If you do not have a UCSF medical record, one will be created for you.  Your signed consent form and some of your research tests will be added to your UCSF medical record.  Therefore, people involved with your future care and insurance may become aware of your participation and of any information added to your medical record as a result of your participation.  Study tests that are performed by research labs, and information gathered directly from you by the researchers will be part of your research records but will not be added to your medical record.  Your personal information may be given out if required by law.  If information from this study is published or presented at scientific meetings, your name and other personal information will not be used.     [If your study involves HIV, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C testing with participants who have not already been diagnosed with those conditions, please add the following statement: California regulations require laboratories to report new cases of HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C infection to the county public health department. The reports include the patient's name, social security number, and other identifying information. Information about these new infections is used to track these diseases statewide and nationwide. Other than this required reporting, your results will be treated confidentially by the study staff. Personally identifying information will not be reported to other departments or agencies.]  [Note: Every subject at the GCRC, PCRC, and VAMC is required to have a medical record. In addition, medical records are generally created any time clinical systems are used at the UCSF Medical Center.  For example, a medical record is created for research participants who undergo CT and MRI scans within the UCSF Medical Center, or who have blood drawn at UCSF Medical Center clinical labs.] Authorized representatives from the following organizations may review your research data for the purpose of monitoring or managing the conduct of this study: * Representatives of the Sponsor [List  Sponsor(s), as applicable] * Representatives of the National Institutes of Health [remove if this is not an NIH-funded study] * Representatives of the University of California * Representatives of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [remove if this is not an FDA-regulated study] *  [list any other agencies - in or outside the US - that might inspect research records] [Sensitive research information/Certificate of Confidentiality:  For studies where investigators may obtain especially sensitive information from subjects (e.g., possible illegal drug use) and seek a Certificate of Confidentiality, use specific consent form wording.]  Will any research-related procedures be billed to me? [For studies in which the sponsor pays all costs:] No.  The sponsor has agreed to pay for all procedures associated with this research study; you or your insurer will not be billed.  [For studies where subjects may be responsible for some costs:] Two types of procedures will be done during this study.  Some are part of your standard medical care and others are only for research.  You or your insurer will be billed for the standard medical care.  You will be responsible for your co-pays, deductibles, and any other charges that your insurer will not pay. There is a possibility that your insurer may not cover all standard medical care costs if you are receiving medical services out of network. Any procedures done only for research will not be charged to you or your insurer. Will I be paid for taking part in this study? In return for your time, effort and travel expenses, you will be paid [$XXX] for taking part in this study. [Describe any pro-rating or bonuses, and specify method and timing of payment. See the IRB website for more info on subject payment and sample consent form language.]  [OR, if there is no payment:] You will not be paid for taking part in this study. What happens if I am injured because I took part in this study? It is important that you tell your study doctor, __________________ [investigator's name(s)], if you feel that you have been injured because of taking part in this study. You can tell the doctor in person or call him/her at __________________ [telephone number]. Treatment and Compensation for Injury:  If you are injured as a result of being in this study, the University of California will provide necessary medical treatment.  The costs of the treatment may be billed to you or your insurer just like any other medical costs, or covered by the University of California or the study sponsor [sponsor name], depending on a number of factors.  The University and the study sponsor do not normally provide any other form of compensation for injury.  For further information about this, you may call the office of the Institutional Review Board at 415- 476-1814.  [NOTE: This statement must be used without changes. See the IRB website and notes section at the end of this sample form for standard wording for the SFVAMC and for other comments]. What are my rights if I take part in this study? Taking part in this study is your choice. You may choose either to take part or not to take part in the study. If you decide to take part in this study, you may leave the study at any time. No matter what decision you make, there will be no penalty to you and you will not lose any of your regular benefits. Leaving the study will not affect your medical care. You can still get your medical care from our institution.  We will tell you about new information or changes in the study that may affect your health or your willingness to continue in the study. In the case of injury resulting from this study, you do not lose any of your legal rights to seek payment by signing this form. Who can answer my questions about the study? You can talk to your study doctor about any questions, concerns, or complaints you have about this study.

Provide yes/no options at each decision point. The following studies are included as examples and therefore are written with italicized font.] Please note: This section of the informed consent form is about optional research studies that are being done with people who are taking part in the main study. You may take part in these optional studies if you want to. You can still be a part of the main study even if you say ""no"" to taking part in any of these optional studies. You can say ""yes"" or ""no"" to each of the following studies. Please mark your choice for each study. [Example: Broad Sharing of Genomic Data] [Include the following wording for broad sharing of genomic data in studies that are subject to the NIH Genomic Data Sharing Policy: http://hrpp.ucsf.edu/node/716] How will my genetic information be shared? Genetic information (also known as genotype data) and the medical record data (also known as phenotype data) may be shared broadly in a coded form for future genetic research or analysis. We may give certain medical information about you (for example, diagnosis, blood pressure, age if less than 85) to other scientists or companies not at UCSF, including to a (public or controlled access) government health research database, but we will not give them your name, address, phone number, or any other identifiable information.  Research results from these studies will not be returned to you (describe any rare instances that this may occur). Donating data may involve a loss of privacy, but information about you will be handled as confidentially as possible. Study data will be physically and electronically secured. As with any use of electronic means to store data, there is a risk of breach of data security.  Genetic information that results from this study does not have medical or treatment importance at this time.  However, there is a risk that information about taking part in a genetic study may influence insurance companies and/or employers regarding your health.  Taking part in a genetic study may also have a negative impact or unintended consequences on family or other relationships.  It is possible that future research could one day help people of the same race, ethnicity, or sex as you.  However, it is also possible through these kinds of studies that genetic traits might come to be associated with your group.  In some cases, this could reinforce harmful stereotypes. There will be no direct benefit to you from allowing your data to be kept and used for  future research. However, we hope we will learn something that will contribute to the advancement of science and understanding of health and disease. If the data or any new products, tests or discoveries that result from this research have potential commercial value, you will not share in any financial benefits.  If you decide later that you do not want your information to be used for future research, you can notify the investigator in writing at [insert address or contact information], and any remaining data will be destroyed.  However, we cannot retract any data has been shared with other researchers.  Please put your initials in the ""YES"" or ""NO"" box to indicate your answer. 1. My specimens and associated data may be kept for use in research to learn about, prevent, or treat [list the disease the specimens are being collected to study]. YES  NO 2. My specimens and associated data may be kept for use in research to learn about, prevent or treat other health problems (for example: diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, or heart disease). YES  NO [Example: Quality of Life Study] We want to know your view of how your life has been affected by cancer and its treatment. This ""Quality of Life"" study looks at how you are feeling physically and emotionally during your cancer treatment. It also looks at how you are able to carry out your day-to-day activities.  This information will help doctors better understand how patients feel during treatments and what effects the medicines are having. In the future, this information may help patients and doctors as they decide which medicines to use to treat cancer.  You will be asked to complete 3 questionnaires: one on your first visit, one 6 months later, and the last one 12 months after your first visit. It takes about 15 minutes to fill out each questionnaire. If any questions make you feel uncomfortable, you may skip those questions and not give an answer. If you decide to take part in this study, the only thing you will be asked to do is fill out the three questionnaires. You may change your mind about completing the questionnaires at any time. Just like in the main study, we will do our best to make sure that your personal information will be kept private. Please put your initials in the ""YES"" or ""NO"" box to indicate your answer. I choose to take part in the Quality of Life Study. YES  NO [Example: Use of Tissue for Research] [Adapted from the NCI Cancer Diagnosis Program's model tissue consent form found at http://www.cancerdiagnosis.nci.nih.gov/specimens/model.pdf]       About Using Tissue for Research You are going to have a biopsy (or surgery) to see if you have cancer. Your doctor will remove some body tissue to do some tests. The results of these tests will be given to you by your doctor and will be used to plan your care. We would like to keep some of the tissue that is left over for future research. If you agree, this tissue will be kept and may be used in research to learn more about cancer and other diseases. Please read the information sheet called ""How Is Tissue Used for Research"" to learn more about tissue research. Your tissue may be helpful for research whether you do or do not have cancer. The research that may be done with your tissue is not designed specifically to help you. It might help people who have cancer and other diseases in the future. Reports about research done with your tissue will not be given to you or your doctor. These reports will not be put in your health record. The research will not have an effect on your care. Things to Think About The choice to let us keep the left over tissue for future research is up to you. No matter what you decide to do, it will not affect your care. If you decide now that your tissue can be kept for research, you can change your mind at any time. Just contact us and let us know that you do not want us to use your tissue. Then any tissue that remains will no longer be used for research. In the future, people who do research may need to know more about your health. While XXX may give them reports about your health, it will not give them your name, address, phone number, or any other information that will let the researchers know who you are. Sometimes tissue is used for genetic research (about diseases that are passed on in families). Even if your tissue is used for this kind of research, the results will not be put in your health records. Your tissue will be used only for research and will not be sold. The research done with your tissue may help to develop new products in the future. Benefits The benefits of research using tissue include learning more about what causes cancer and other diseases, how to prevent them, and how to treat them. Risks The greatest risk to you is the release of information from your health records. We will do our best to make sure that your personal information will be kept private. The chance that this information will be given to someone else is very small. Making Your Choice Please read each sentence below and think about your choice. After reading each sentence, put your initials in the ""Yes"" or ""No"" box.  If you have any questions, please talk to your doctor or nurse, or call our research review board at IRB's phone number. No matter what you decide to do, it will not affect your care. 1. My tissue may be kept for use in research to learn about, prevent, or treat cancer. YES  NO 2. My tissue may be kept for use in research to learn about, prevent or treat other health problems (for example: diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, or heart disease). YES  NO 3. Someone may contact me in the future to ask me to take part in more research. YES  NO  CONSENT  You have been given copies of this consent form and the Experimental Subject's Bill of Rights to keep.  [If Protected Health Information as defined by HIPAA will be accessed, used, created, or disclosed, add the following: You will be asked to sign a separate form authorizing access, use, creation, or disclosure of health information about you.]  PARTICIPATION IN RESEARCH IS VOLUNTARY. You have the right to decline to participate or to withdraw at any point in this study without penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled.  If you wish to participate in this study, you should sign below.   											 Date			Participant's Signature for Consent   											 Date			Person Obtaining Consent  [STOP!

By signing below, you are giving your permission for your child to be  included in this study.   											 Date			Parent or Legal Guardian  NOTES TO PERSON PREPARING CONSENT FORM 1. Consent Document Identification Required by the IRB Version date and short identifier: Every consent document (consent forms, assent forms, information sheets) must include a version date (month, day, year) in a lower corner of each page. This date should be hard coded -- in other words, the date should not update automatically each time you open the document.  The version date should only be changed when the document is modified. If multiple consent documents are used for the study, include a short identifier in the footer on each page to distinguish between the various consent documents.  Any changes in the consent documents require IRB review. Page numbering: The pages of every consent document should be numbered, preferably in a format like ""1 of 2,"" ""2 of 2,"" in the footer of the document. Approval stamp: Approved consent documents in iRIS will receive an approval stamp. To accommodate the stamp, each consent document should have at least a 1.25"" top margin and the upper left-hand corner should be blank. Learn more about IRB approval documentation.  2. ""Treatment and Compensation for Injury"" Statement  VAMC Studies with Sponsor: The VA has specific wording that must be used, which can be found on the IRB website.  Additional Notes Regarding the UCSF ""Treatment and Compensation for Injury"" Wording: Sponsoring companies often request that their own wording be used for the treatment and compensation for injury policy statement or that minor changes be made in the UC statement.  Such requests cannot be honored.   Industry sponsors have three, and only three, options regarding the discussion of treatment and compensation for injury in the consent form.  First, the sponsor may include its name in the UCSF statement as written in this sample consent form.  Second, the sponsor may remain silent on this point, in which case all reference to the sponsor should be omitted from the standard statement.  Third, a brief paragraph (one or two sentences) may be added below and separate from the UCSF statement to explain the sponsor's policy.  However, any description of the sponsor's policy must state what the sponsor will cover, not what it will not cover.  As a further limitation, the sponsor's statement may not make reference to third party carriers, government programs, or lost wages. No other changes may be made to the UCSF statement, as described on the IRB website.  3. Handling Health Information and Complying with HIPAA  HIPAA has specific and strict requirements for use of identifiable information from medical records (which HIPAA calls protected health information or PHI).  HIPAA uses different terminology from other human subject protection regulations. Under HIPAA, research subjects must give authorization (consent) for use of their PHI. For almost all studies, UCSF requires using separate forms for research consent and for HIPAA-specific authorization for research access to health information.  See HIPAA guidance.  Under HIPAA, any disclosure of PHI that is not specifically included in an individual's authorization is prohibited and is subject to penalties. Neither the type of information that will be shared, the use that will be made of the information, nor the persons with whom information will be shared can be changed unless the subject signs a new authorization.  This means that if the researchers want to share PHI with any person, company, or institution not already included in the authorization form, the IRB Application and authorization form (and sometimes the consent form) must be modified and each person about whom information would be shared must be asked to sign the new form(s).

""serious"" is defined as side effects that may require hospitalization or may be irreversible, long-term, life threatening or fatal. * side effects that occur in less than 2-3% of patients do not have to be listed unless they are serious, and should then appear in the ""rare but serious"" category. * physical and non-physical risks and side effects should include such things as the inability to work. whenever possible, describe side effects by how they make a patient feel, for example, ""loss of red blood cells, also called anemia, can cause tiredness, weakness and shortness of breath."" * for some investigational drugs/ interventions/ devices there may be side effects that have been noted during treatment, but not enough data is available to determine if the side effect is related to the drug/ intervention/ device. inclusion of this information in the informed consent document is not mandatory, but it may be prudent to mention the most serious effects. if included, these side effects should be listed under a separate category titled ""side effects reported by patients, but not proven to be caused by [drug/ intervention/ device]."" side effects in this category do not have to be labeled as ""likely,"" ""less likely,"" or ""rare but serious"" and should not be repeated here if they appear in a previous category. similar to the other categories, these side effects should be listed in a bulleted format.] [if appropriate to the study, include the following risk statement(s) using irb wording:] * randomization risks: you will be assigned to a treatment program by chance, and the treatment you receive may prove to be less effective or to have more side effects than the other study treatment(s) or other available treatments. * placebo risks: if you are in the group that receives placebo, your condition will go without the active (study) treatment for [xx weeks]. * blood drawing (venipuncture) risks: drawing blood may cause temporary discomfort from the needle stick, bruising, infection, and fainting. * radiation risks: [include one of the three paragraphs below if your study involves radiation. the paragraph you include will depend on the total effective dose from all treatments used, regardless of whether they are standard of care or experimental. studies in which patients will receive different total effective doses should either use the maximum possible dose that a patient could receive or use multiple consent forms. in no instance should a patient receive more radiation than the maximum stated on the consent form.] total effective dose of <3 msv this research study involves exposure to radiation from [type of procedure]. this radiation exposure is not necessary for your medical care and is for research purposes only. the additional amount of radiation that you will receive as a result of participating in this study will be less than the yearly natural background radiation in the us (3 msv). the use of radiation involves minimal risk and is required to obtain the desired research information. if you are pregnant or breast feeding, you should not participate in this study. if you have any questions regarding the use of radiation or the risks involved, please consult the physician conducting the study. effective dose of 3 to 50 msv this research study involves exposure to radiation from [type of procedure]. this radiation exposure is not necessary for your medical care and is for research purposes only. the additional amount of radiation that you will receive as a result of participating in this study will be a maximum of approximately [insert amount] msv, which is equivalent to [insert amount] the yearly natural background of radiation in the us (3 msv). the use of radiation may involve a low risk of cancer and is required to obtain the desired research information. if you are pregnant or breast feeding, you should not participate in this study. if you have any questions regarding the use of radiation or the risks involved, please consult the physician conducting the study. effective dose of >50 msv this research study involves exposure to radiation as part of the protocol. this radiation exposure is not necessary for your medical care and is for research purposes only. the additional amount of radiation that you will receive as a result of participating in this study will be a maximum of approximately [insert amount] msv, which is equivalent to [insert amount] the yearly natural background of radiation in the us (3 msv). the use of radiation in this research study involves a low risk of cancer. however, the ucsf radiation safety committee has reviewed the use of radiation in this research study and has designated this use as acceptable to obtain the benefits provided by the results of the study. if you are pregnant or breast feeding, you should not participate in this study. if you have any questions regarding the use of radiation or the risks involved, please consult the physician conducting the study. radiation therapy: [for situations involving radiation therapy, special risk language should be developed on a case-specific basis with the radiation safety committee. doses to individual organs should always be discussed, but the use of effective dose and comparison to background exposures is not appropriate.] * ct scan risks: ct scans involve the risks of radiation (see above). in addition, if contrast material (iodine dye) is used, there is a slight risk of developing an allergic reaction, from mild (itching, rash) to severe (difficulty breathing, shock, or rarely, death). the contrast material may also cause kidney problems, especially if you are dehydrated or have poor kidney function. the study doctors will ask you about any allergies or related conditions before the procedure. if you have any of these problems, you may not be allowed to have a ct scan [/continue in the study]. having a ct scan may mean some added discomfort for you. in particular, you may be bothered by feelings of claustrophobia when placed inside the ct scanner, or by lying in one position for a long time. if contrast material is used, you may feel discomfort when it is injected [/given by xxx]. you may feel warm and flushed and get a metallic taste in your mouth. rarely, the contrast material may cause nausea, vomiting or a headache. [list other risks as appropriate to the method by which contrast agent is administered]. [if sedation may be used, discuss risks of sedation here]. * mri risks: because the mri machine acts like a large magnet, it could move iron-containing objects in the mri room during your examination, which in the process could possibly harm you. precautions have been taken to prevent such an event from happening; loose metal objects, like pocket knives or key chains, are not allowed in the mri room. if you have a piece of metal in your body, such as a fragment in your eye, aneurysm clips, ear implants, spinal nerve stimulators, or a pacemaker, you will not be allowed into the mri room and cannot have an mri. having an mri may mean some added discomfort for you. in particular, you may be bothered by feelings of claustrophobia and by the loud banging noise during the study. temporary hearing loss has been reported from this loud noise. this is why you will be asked to wear earplugs. at times during the test, you may be asked to not swallow for a while, which can be uncomfortable. because the risks to a fetus from mri are unknown, pregnant women must not participate in this study. [if appropriate, also discuss the risks of contrast agents and/or sedation here. for example:] contrast agent (gadolinium) risks: a few side effects of gadolinium injection such as mild headache, nausea, and local pain may occur. rarely (less than 1% of the time) low blood pressure and lightheadedness occurs. this can be treated immediately with intravenous fluids. very rarely (less than on in one thousand), patients are allergic to gadolinium. these effects are most commonly hives and itchy eyes, but more severe reactions have been seen which result in shortness of breath. patients with severe kidney disease sometimes have a bad reaction to gadolinium contrast. the condition is called nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (nsf). it can cause skin to tighten or scar and can damage internal organs. sometimes it can be life-threatening. there are no reports of nsf in patients with normal kidney function. before you have a mri scan requiring an injection of gadolinium contrast, you will have a blood test in order to check the function of your kidneys. based on your medical history and the results of the test, a doctor will decide whether it is safe for you to undergo the mri scans. * reproductive risks: you should not become pregnant or father a baby while on this study because the drugs in this study can affect an unborn baby. women should not breastfeed a baby while on this study. it is important to understand that you need to use birth control while on this study. check with your study doctor about what kind of birth control methods to use and how long to use them. some methods might not be approved for use in this study. [include a statement about possible sterility when appropriate. for example, ""some of the drugs used in the study may make you unable to have children in the future."" if appropriate, include a statement in the section on procedures that pregnancy testing will be required.] * hiv testing risks: being tested for hiv may cause anxiety regardless of the test results. a positive test indicates that you have been infected with the hiv virus. if you test positive we will refer you to a source of medical care and treatment. receiving positive results may make you very upset. if other people learn about your positive test results, you may face discrimination. if your test is negative, there is still the possibility that you could be infected with the hiv virus and test positive at some time in the future. * safe handling of medications: handling [insert name of medication] and having contact with any urine, feces or vomit from patients receiving [name of medication] may pose some risk to you and your caregivers. to avoid exposure to [name of medication] and any associated risks, you and your family members/caregivers will be educated by a member of the study team on how to safely handle [name of medication], properly dispose of [name of medication], and how to clean products that may be contaminated with [name of medication].

[example: broad sharing of genomic data] [include the following wording for broad sharing of genomic data in studies that are subject to the nih genomic data sharing policy: http://hrpp.ucsf.edu/node/716] how will my genetic information be shared genetic information (also known as genotype data) and the medical record data (also known as phenotype data) may be shared broadly in a coded form for future genetic research or analysis. we may give certain medical information about you (for example, diagnosis, blood pressure, age if less than 85) to other scientists or companies not at ucsf, including to a (public or controlled access) government health research database, but we will not give them your name, address, phone number, or any other identifiable information. research results from these studies will not be returned to you (describe any rare instances that this may occur). donating data may involve a loss of privacy, but information about you will be handled as confidentially as possible. study data will be physically and electronically secured. as with any use of electronic means to store data, there is a risk of breach of data security. genetic information that results from this study does not have medical or treatment importance at this time. however, there is a risk that information about taking part in a genetic study may influence insurance companies and/or employers regarding your health. taking part in a genetic study may also have a negative impact or unintended consequences on family or other relationships. it is possible that future research could one day help people of the same race, ethnicity, or sex as you. however, it is also possible through these kinds of studies that genetic traits might come to be associated with your group. in some cases, this could reinforce harmful stereotypes. there will be no direct benefit to you from allowing your data to be kept and used for future research. however, we hope we will learn something that will contribute to the advancement of science and understanding of health and disease. if the data or any new products, tests or discoveries that result from this research have potential commercial value, you will not share in any financial benefits. if you decide later that you do not want your information to be used for future research, you can notify the

looks at how you are feeling physically and emotionally during your cancer treatment. it also looks at how you are able to carry out your day-to-day activities. this information will help doctors better understand how patients feel during treatments and what effects the medicines are having. in the future, this information may help patients and doctors as they decide which medicines to use to treat cancer. you will be asked to complete 3 questionnaires: one on your first visit, one 6 months later, and the last one 12 months after your first visit. it takes about 15 minutes to fill out each questionnaire. if any questions make you feel uncomfortable, you may skip those questions and not give an answer. if you decide to take part in this study, the only thing you will be asked to do is fill out the three questionnaires. you may change your mind about completing the questionnaires at any time. just like in the main study, we will do our best to make sure that your personal information will be kept private. please put your initials in the ""yes"" or ""no"" box to indicate your answer. i choose to take part in the quality of life study. yes no [example: use of tissue for research] [adapted from the nci cancer diagnosis program's model tissue consent form found at http://www.cancerdiagnosis.nci.nih.gov/specimens/model.pdf] about using tissue for research you are going to have a biopsy (or surgery) to see if you have cancer. your doctor will remove some body tissue to do some tests. the results of these tests will be given to you by your doctor and will be used to plan your care. we would like to keep some of the tissue that is left over for future research. if you agree, this tissue will be kept and may be used in research to learn more about cancer and other diseases. please read the information sheet called ""how is tissue used for research"" to learn more about tissue research. your tissue may be helpful for research whether you do or do not have cancer. the research that may be done with your tissue is not designed specifically to help you. it might help people who have cancer and other diseases in the future. reports about research done with your tissue will not be given to you or your doctor. these reports will not be put in your health record. the research will not have an effect on your care. things to think about the choice to let us keep the left over tissue for future research is up to you. no matter what you decide to do, it will not affect your care. if you decide now that your tissue can be kept for research, you can change your mind at any time. just contact us and let us know that you do not want us to use your tissue. then any tissue that remains will no longer be used for research. in the future, people who do research may need to know more about your health. while xxx may give them reports about your health, it will not give them your name, address, phone number, or any other information that will let the researchers know who you are. sometimes tissue is used for genetic research (about diseases that are passed on in families). even if your tissue is used for this kind of research, the results will not be put in your health records. your tissue will be used only for research and will not be sold. the research done with your tissue may help to develop new products in the future. benefits the benefits of research using tissue include learning more about what causes cancer and other diseases, how to prevent them, and how to treat them. risks the greatest risk to you is the release of information from your health records. we will do our best to make sure that your personal information will be kept private. the chance that this information will be given to someone else is very small. making your choice please read each sentence below and think about your choice. after reading each sentence, put your initials in the ""yes"" or ""no"" box. if you have any questions, please talk to your doctor or nurse, or call our research review board at irb's phone number. no matter what you decide to do, it will not affect your care. 1. my tissue may be kept for use in research to learn about, prevent, or treat cancer. yes no 2. my tissue may be kept for use in research to learn about, prevent or treat other health problems (for example: diabetes, alzheimer's disease, or heart disease). yes

""treatment and compensation for injury"" statement vamc studies with sponsor: the va has specific wording that must be used, which can be found on the irb website. additional notes regarding the ucsf ""treatment and compensation for injury"" wording: sponsoring companies often request that their own wording be used for the treatment and compensation for injury policy statement or that minor changes be made in the uc statement. such requests cannot be honored. industry sponsors have three, and only three, options regarding the discussion of treatment and compensation for injury in the consent form. first, the sponsor may include its name in the ucsf statement as written in this sample consent form. second, the sponsor may remain silent on this point, in which case all reference to the sponsor should be omitted from the standard statement. third, a brief paragraph (one or two sentences) may be added below and separate from the ucsf statement to explain the sponsor's policy. however, any description of the sponsor's policy must state what the sponsor will cover, not what it will not cover. as a further limitation, the sponsor's statement may not make reference to third party carriers, government programs, or lost wages. no other changes may be made to the ucsf statement, as described on the irb website. 3. handling health information and complying with hipaa hipaa has specific and strict requirements for use of identifiable information from medical records (which hipaa calls protected health information or phi). hipaa uses different terminology from other human subject protection regulations. under hipaa, research subjects must give authorization (consent) for use of their phi. for almost all studies, ucsf requires using separate forms for research consent and for hipaa-specific authorization for research access to health information. see hipaa guidance. under hipaa, any disclosure of phi that is not specifically included in an individual's authorization is prohibited and is subject to penalties. neither the type of information that will be shared, the use that will be made of the information, nor the persons with whom information will be shared can be changed unless the subject signs a new authorization. this means that if the researchers want to share phi with any person, company, or institution not already included in the authorization form, the irb application and authorization form (and sometimes the consent form) must be modified and each person about whom information would be shared must be asked to sign the new form(s).

This format can be used for studies with a very complex protocol and/or involving adolescent subjects whose medical condition demands a simpler form than the adult's form, even when the adult's form is written at an eighth-grade level.  UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO (UCSF)  ASSENT TO PARTICIPATE IN A RESEARCH SUBJECT of a New Drug, THX333, to Treat Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)  For adolescents 13-17 years old  What is this study about? Keith Chavez, Ph.D., Linda Wong, Ph.D., and Glen McSweeney, M.D., Ph.D., from the UCSF Department of Psychiatry, are doing a research study.  The study will test if THX333 is safe for children and adolescents.  THX333 is a new medicine for ADHD.  It is made by the Smith Pharmaceutical Company.  The study doctors hope this drug will help young people with ADHD get better, but they don't know if it will for sure.  That's why they're doing the study.  Because you have ADHD, the doctors are asking if you want to be in this study.   How many people will take part in this study? About 300 children and adolescents (6 to 17 years old), across the United States, will be in this study.  About 30 of them will participate at UCSF.  What will happen if you decide you might want to be in this research study? First, your parents will be asked if they give their permission for you to be in this study. They will also be asked if they agree to participate themselves, by doing some things like answering questions about you. If your parents don't agree, you cannot be in the study.  If your parents do agree, and you agree too, here's what will happen next:     Before you begin the study: 1. The study doctor will ask your parents some questions about you.  2. The study doctor will ask you questions about your health.   3. You will have a physical exam, and you will give some urine and some blood for the doctors to test.   4. Some of the urine collected from you will be tested for illegal drugs, in order to see if you can be included in the study.  If any illegal drugs are found in your urine, you and your parents will be told, and you won't be able to be in the study.  5. You will also get an ECG.  During an ECG, sticky patches are placed on your chest, arms, and legs.  These patches connect to wires that go to a machine that measures the electrical activity of your heart.  ONLY GIRLS NEED TO READ THE NEXT SECTION, #6:  6. If the study medicine is taken by a girl who is pregnant (having a baby), it could harm the baby.  Therefore we want to make sure that nobody who is pregnant is taking this medicine.    It is possible for a girl who has had her first menstrual period and has started sexual activity to become pregnant.  So if you have had your first menstrual period, whether you have had sexual activity or not, a urine test will be done at the first visit. Also your blood will be tested twice, at the first and last visit, to make sure you are not pregnant.  If you start being sexually active during the study, you must use a reliable way of preventing pregnancy, for example, a condom along with a sperm-killing jelly, or a pill that prevents pregnancy.  If you are having sex but are not sure if the type of sex you are having can cause you to get pregnant, or if you are not sure if you are using a reliable way of preventing pregnancy, please ask the study doctor to explain. As you probably know, the most reliable way to avoid getting pregnant is to not have sex.  If you think you might be pregnant, you must stop using the study medicine immediately and notify the study doctor or the study staff.  You and your parents will be told if you have a positive pregnancy test (in other words, if the urine or blood test shows that you are pregnant).  ALL (GIRLS AND BOYS) CONTINUE TO READ HERE:     During the study: 7. If you are going to stay in the research study after the questions and tests described above, you will have to stop any medication for ADHD you are currently taking.  8. Then you will start taking one study pill every morning.  You will either get THX333 pills or placebo pills (pills that have no effect).  You will not know which kind of pills you are taking, and neither will your doctors or your parents, until the end of the study.  9. During the 16 weeks of the study, you will need to visit the clinic at least 11 more times for physical exams and blood tests.  Each visit will last 1 to 3 hours.  10. Your parents will help make sure you take the study pills, and they will be asked more questions about you throughout the study.     When the study ends: 11. You and your parents will be able to find out whether you were getting the THX333 pills or the placebo pills.    If you were getting the THX333 pills and they seemed to be helping you, your regular doctor might be able to prescribe something like THX333 after the study ends.  But no children or adolescents will be able to get THX333 for ADHD outside the study because it is still being tested.  Will any parts of this study hurt or have other risks? Blood drawing may hurt when the needle is put into and taken out of your arm.  You will be asked if you want to use a numbing medicine on your skin to try to make it hurt less.  Sometimes when the sticky patches for the ECG are taken off they can hurt a little bit, like when a bandage is pulled off your skin.  You may have side effects from the study medicine.  If you feel any side effects, you should tell your parents or the study doctor about this right away.  If you were taking medicine for your ADHD before, and you get the placebo pills in the study, it might turn out the placebo pills don't help you as much as your old medicine did.  Will you get better if you are in this study? We don't know if this study will make you feel better. You may get a little better by being in this study, or you may stay the same, or you may get worse.  What if you have questions? You can ask Dr. Chavez, Dr. Wong, Dr. McSweeney, or the people who work with them any questions you have about the study.  You can ask your questions now or later, any time you like.  You can also ask your parents to ask questions for you.  What are your choices? If your parents agree, you can be in this study if you want to. But you don't have to be in it if you don't want to.  Nobody will get mad at you if you don't want to do this.    If you don't want to be in the study, you can continue the medication that you take now.  Or if you don't take any medication right now, your doctor may be able to find an available medication that works for you. Or you may not want any medication now.  If you decide to be in the study now and you change your mind later, that's okay, too.   You just have to tell the study doctor or the study staff as soon as you change your mind, and you will be taken out of the study.  ************************************************************** If you don't want to be in this study, just say so, and don't sign this form.

level. university of california san francisco (ucsf) assent to participate in a research subject of a new drug, thx333, to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (adhd) for adolescents 13-17 years old what is this study about keith chavez, ph.d., linda wong, ph.d., and glen mcsweeney, m.d., ph.d., from the ucsf department of psychiatry, are doing a research study. the study will test if thx333 is safe for children and adolescents. thx333 is a new medicine for adhd. it is made by the smith pharmaceutical company. the study doctors hope this drug will help young people with adhd get better, but they don't know if it will for sure. that's why they're doing the study. because you have adhd, the doctors are asking if you want to be in this study. how many people will take part in this study about 300 children and adolescents (6 to 17 years old), across the united states, will be in this study. about 30 of them will participate at ucsf. what will happen if you decide you might want to be in this research study first, your parents will be asked if they give their permission for you to be in this study. they will also be asked if they agree to participate themselves, by doing some things like answering questions about you. if your parents don't agree, you cannot be in the study. if your parents do agree, and you agree too, here's what will happen next: before you begin the study: 1. the study doctor will ask your parents some questions about you. 2. the study doctor will ask you questions about your health. 3. you will have a physical exam, and you will give some urine and some blood for the doctors to test. 4. some of the urine collected from you will be tested for illegal drugs, in order to see if you can be included in the study. if any illegal drugs are found in your urine, you and your parents will be told, and you won't be able to be in the study. 5. you will also get an ecg. during an ecg, sticky patches are placed on your chest, arms, and legs. these patches connect to wires that go to a machine that measures the electrical activity of your heart. only girls need to read the next section, #6: 6. if the study medicine is taken by a girl who is pregnant (having a baby), it could harm the baby. therefore we want to make sure that nobody who is pregnant is taking this medicine. it is possible for a girl who has had her first menstrual period and has started sexual activity to become pregnant. so if you have had your first menstrual period, whether you have had sexual activity or not, a urine test will be done at the first visit. also your blood will be tested twice, at the first and last visit, to make sure you are not pregnant. if you start being sexually active during the study, you must use a reliable way of preventing pregnancy, for example, a condom along with a sperm-killing jelly, or a pill that prevents pregnancy. if you are having sex but are not sure if the type of sex you are having can cause you to get pregnant, or if you are not sure if you are using a reliable way of preventing pregnancy, please ask the study doctor to explain. as you probably know, the most reliable way to avoid getting pregnant is to not have sex. if you think you might be pregnant, you must stop using the study medicine immediately and notify the study doctor or the study staff. you and your parents will be told if you have a positive pregnancy test (in other words, if the urine or blood test shows that you are pregnant). all (girls and boys) continue to read here: during the study: 7. if you are going to stay in the research study after the questions and tests described above, you will have to stop any medication for adhd you are currently taking. 8. then you will start taking one study pill every morning. you will either get thx333 pills or placebo pills (pills that have no effect). you will not know which kind of pills you are taking, and neither will your doctors or your parents, until the end of the study. 9. during the 16 weeks of the study, you will need to visit the clinic at least 11 more times for physical exams and blood tests. each visit will last 1 to 3 hours. 10. your parents will help make sure you take the study pills, and they will be asked more questions about you throughout the study. when the study ends: 11. you and your parents will be able to find out whether you were getting the thx333 pills or the placebo pills. if you were getting the thx333 pills and they seemed to be helping you, your regular doctor might be able to prescribe something like thx333 after the study ends. but no children or adolescents will be able to get thx333 for adhd outside the study because it is still being tested. will any parts of this study hurt or have other risks blood drawing may hurt when the needle is put into and taken out of your arm. you will be asked if you want to use a numbing medicine on your skin to try to make it hurt less. sometimes when the sticky patches for the ecg are taken off they can hurt a little bit, like when a bandage is pulled off your skin. you may have side effects from the study medicine. if you feel any side effects, you should tell your parents or the study doctor about this right away. if you were taking medicine for your adhd before, and you get the placebo pills in the study, it might turn out the placebo pills don't help you as much as your old medicine did. will you get better if you are in this study we don't know if this study will make you feel better. you may get a little better by being in this study, or you may stay the same, or you may get worse. what if you have questions you can ask dr. chavez, dr. wong, dr. mcsweeney, or the people who work with them any questions you have about the study. you can ask your questions now or later, any time you like. you can also ask your parents to ask questions for you. what are your choices if your parents agree, you can be in this study if you want to. but you don't have to be in it if you don't want to. nobody will get mad at you if you don't want to do this. if you don't want to be in the study, you can continue the medication that you take now. or if you don't take any medication right now, your doctor may be able to find an available medication that works for you. or you may not want any medication now. if you decide to be in the study now and you change your mind later, that's

The nature of the test and how it will be performed.   What is the Columbia Combined Genetic Panel (CCGP)?   The Columbia Combined Panel is a genetic test that evaluates changes in your DNA that might be the cause  of your clinical condition.  A gene is an individual unit of DNA. Exons are the most important regions of the gene that  provide the instructions for the body to make proteins and chemicals that allow it to function properly.  Changes in  genes, called mutations, can lead to disease. The Columbia Combined Panel tests for exons of many genes at the  same time. The genes are chosen based on their known role in disease that cause symptoms like yours. Because  this test examines a larger portion of the genetic material than traditional tests, it might discover the cause of disease  in cases where other tests were inconclusive. Because the Columbia Combined Panel is more complicated than prior  genetic testing you may have had, the consent and ordering process must be thorough and will be done with the  assistance of a genetic counselor and/or your doctor.   How is the test done?    Two tubes (two teaspoons) of blood will be collected from you.  Based on your family tree, your genetic  counselor or doctor may also recommend that blood be drawn from two or more members of your family, such as  your parents or siblings, to help with interpretation of test results.  The genes tested by the CCGP are part of the DNA  in your blood cells. DNA from your blood is purified, and the exome sequence is obtained (or “read”) using high  throughput sequencing. The sequence obtained for the genes included in the CCGP is then searched for changes  that are known or suspected to cause disease.   How is this test interpreted?   Once the DNA sequence of the exons of the genes of interest is read, the information obtained is analyzed  for differences between your sequence and a reference (“normal) sequence.  Everyone has places in their sequence  that are different from the reference. These differences make us unique and usually do not cause medical problems.   To determine whether the changes that are found are neutral, or can cause disease, the following steps are taken:  First, the variations in your sequence will be compared with a list of mutations that are known to cause  medical problems in other people with symptoms similar to yours. Subsequently one will examine whether disruptive  mutations not previously described are present in genes that are known to cause the type of disease you have.  Changes found will be compared to the changes seen in your selected family members with or without the disease (if  available) to confirm that the changes are indeed the cause of your disease.     2. The Primary Purpose of the test (why it is being performed).   The test is being performed primarily to detect one (or more than one) genetic cause for your condition. The condition   you are being tested for is _____________________, which causes ___________________________________.    The test results may be complex, so you must obtain genetic counseling before signing  this consent.        th Personalized Genomic Medicine Laboratory  630 West 168  Street  Department of Pathology and Cell Biology  P&S17-401  www.pathology.columbia.edu  New York, NY 10032    Tel: 212-305-9706  OFFICE USE   O :   Fax: 212-342-0420  NLY CCGP sequencing reviewed:  Lab Acc. #:__________  3. What kinds of results may be obtained, what is their significance for health, and what  should you do after receiving the results?    What kind of results may be reported?  There are several different kinds of results that may be reported. All results will go directly to your doctor or  your other healthcare provider who ordered the test.  1. Positive for disease-causing mutation(s): You may have one or more genetic changes that are known to  cause a specific genetic condition in other individuals with similar symptoms.  The variant or variants  would then be called a mutation or mutations and would be interpreted as the cause of your symptoms.  2. No disease causing mutation(s) found: It is possible that the test will not find any genetic change that  could explain your symptoms.  This type of test result does not mean your condition is not genetic. The  result would not take away whatever current diagnoses doctors may have given for your condition.   3. Variant with uncertain significance: Sometimes the test will find a variation that is predicted to be  important, but has not been reported or seen before in people with your condition.  Such a variant may or  may not be the cause of your symptoms. The lab would report it as a “variant with uncertain significance”  if there is evidence strongly suggesting that it is related to your condition.    Are there any types of results that will not be given to me?  Yes, there are a few types of results that will not be included in the report your doctor gets.   1. Mutations that are not directly related to your condition (incidental findings) will not be reported.  2. We might use your relatives’ samples to help us diagnose your condition, but we will not report results for  these individuals. However, your genetic results might have implications for your relatives. It is important  that you discuss these implications with your genetic counselor.  3. The DNA that will be tested on the sequencer will include genes that are not related to your condition.   We will NOT analyze these genes. Therefore, results for these genes will NOT be available to you OR  us, and will not be reported. IF your doctor decides to test for the other genes in our large panel of genes,  he/she will have to order another test.     What should I do if there is a positive result?               This is a test to identify a genetic cause of your clinical condition. If the test is positive for a genetic cause of  your clinical condition, you may wish to consult your physician or have further genetic counseling or undergo further  independent testing.  ____ (Initial) I understand that I have the option to seek further independent testing, and that I should obtain genetic  counseling to help me understand the results.   Are there limitations to the testing?  Yes, there are several limitations to the Columbia Combined Genetic Panel:  1. The test will not detect mutations in genes that are not known to be associated with your symptoms.   2. The test report is generated based on current medical knowledge. A mutation that is not known to be the  cause of a genetic condition today may be shown to be disease-causing in a year or two.  We do not  generate updated reports for the test, unless we are requested to do so by the patient. There is a fee  th Personalized Genomic Medicine Laboratory  630 West 168  Street  Department of Pathology and Cell Biology  P&S17-401  www.pathology.columbia.edu  New York, NY 10032    Tel: 212-305-9706  OFFICE USE   O :   Fax: 212-342-0420  NLY CCGP sequencing reviewed:  Lab Acc. #:__________  associated with providing an updated report.    3. The test is not currently validated to detect large-scale alterations in the DNA content of the patient’s  cells.  These include losses or duplications of many genes.  Another genetic test called “microarray” is  available for this purpose.  A microarray test might be ordered by your physician before the CCGP  testing.  4. The test may not be able to detect genetic disorders that are caused by expansion of repetitive regions of  the genome. One example is Fragile X syndrome.  If one of these conditions is suspected, your physician  should order the appropriate test.  5. The test is not able to detect mutations in the part of the DNA that is not part of the exons, (the coding  portion of the gene), such as parts of the DNA that help regulate gene function.   6. The test may detect findings of uncertain significance, which cannot be proven with complete certainty to  be the cause of your condition (see types of results described above).  7. Finding a disease-causing mutation may not result in a treatment, cure, or a prognosis (knowledge about  how a disease is expected to progress).   8. Standard lab limitations caused by human error, such as sample contamination or sample mix-up, may  occur but are unlikely.  ____ (Initial) I understand the limitations to CCGP  4. When DNA testing detects the most common disease-causing changes in a gene, the  test result is highly accurate.  5. Implications of positive and negative results for your diagnosis  Predicting the results of the CCGP in advance is not possible. Predicting in advance what the results will mean for  your health is also not possible. This is due to the fact that many genes are tested and many different positive results  can be obtained. Each of these different results will have potentially different implications.  A negative result (not  finding variants) will not change your clinical diagnosis.   6. Who will have access to the results?               The results of the CCGP will become a part of your medical record. Test results are stored in the laboratory’s  computer records, and are normally automatically sent to computerized medical records of New York Presbyterian  Hospital and Columbia University. If you do not want these results to be sent to these records, you must inform us  about this. Unless you tell us not to transmit them, the results will become part of your electronic medical record.  Even if they do not become part of the electronic medical record, the results may be made available to  individuals/organizations with legal access to your medical record, on a strict “need-to-know” basis. Those with legal  access include, but are not limited to, the physicians and nursing staff directly involved in your care, the your current  and future insurance carriers and others specifically authorized by you or your authorized representative to gain  access to your medical records.  ____ __(Initial) I understand, that the results will be automatically transmitted to my electronic medical records in the  NYPH and Columbia University EMRs. I do not object to this.   _______(Initial) Please do not transmit any of the results to the hospital or university electronic medical records. I  understand that the results will continue to be part of the laboratory’s electronic information system. If test results are  not entered into my hospital or university electronic medical records, future physicians may not have access to those  results. I understand that I must assume responsibility for informing my future physicians about findings of CCGP test  that affect my healthcare.     th Personalized Genomic Medicine Laboratory  630 West 168  Street  Department of Pathology and Cell Biology  P&S17-401  www.pathology.columbia.edu  New York, NY 10032    Tel: 212-305-9706  OFFICE USE   O :   Fax: 212-342-0420  NLY CCGP sequencing reviewed:  Lab Acc. #:__________  7. How long are the CCGP results kept in the testing lab?  The laboratory will keep the identified CCGP raw data in the lab for 5 years. The final report will be kept as  long as possible, at least 5 years.  After this, the data from which the final report was generated will be de-identified,  and will be stored in a database that does not include any names or other information that would link them back to  any individual. However, information about the type of disease and the type of symptoms associated with the genetic  findings will be preserved.  Because this is a new test, it is important to keep track of the types of mutations and  variants that are being found in association with particular diseases. This helps us improve our diagnostic  capabilities. This might not directly benefit you, but it might benefit future patients with similar conditions. Please  indicate your choice below.  ____ (Initial) I agree to my CCGP data being stored indefinitely in a de-identified way.  ____ (Initial) I do not want my CCGP data being stored indefinitely, even if it is de-identified.    8. Statement that no additional tests will be performed on this sample, without specific,  signed authorization by the patient/legal representative, and that after 60 days, unless  consent is given, the sample will be destroyed.  --How long are the samples kept in the lab?  Blood and DNA samples are normally discarded after 60 days following test completion, unless you provide  us consent to store the DNA after testing is performed.  Storing your sample may allow you to request testing in the  future without having to obtain a new sample, or to participate in future research, should you wish to do so.   ____ (Initial) The laboratory may keep my DNA used in my CCGP testing indefinitely should I desire such testing, or  if I want to participate in research in the future. I understand that no additional genetic tests will be performed without  my specific consent/instructions. The DNA may be used only for quality control purposes. There is no guarantee of  availability past 60 days. If I decide to participate in research in the future, I will instruct the laboratory, and there will  be a requirement of a separate IRB-approved consent).  ____ (Initial) Do not keep my DNA used in my CCGP testing linked to information that can identify who I am. I  consent to the use of my de-identified DNA for quality control purposes or for research in which my identity cannot be  determined. I understand that any research using the de-identified DNA will require a specific IRB approval and  oversight.   ____ (Initial) Please discard DNA and other biologic materials used in my CCGP testing, 60 days after all testing is  completed.   9. What are the risks of testing?   1. Identification of familial relationships: CCGP may identify familial relationships other than those originally  reported.  For example, non-paternity (when the reported father of the child is not the biological father) or  half sibling-ships (when siblings do not share the same father AND mother) would be detected. You may  choose whether or not to be informed of this information, in case it is revealed during the testing.     2. Discrimination. The genetic non-discrimination law prevents insurance companies from using your  genetic information to deny health insurance coverage. However, the law does not cover life insurance,  th Personalized Genomic Medicine Laboratory  630 West 168  Street  Department of Pathology and Cell Biology  P&S17-401  www.pathology.columbia.edu  New York, NY 10032    Tel: 212-305-9706  OFFICE USE   O :   Fax: 212-342-0420  NLY CCGP sequencing reviewed:  Lab Acc. #:__________  disability insurance or long term care insurance. The detection of an incidental condition may affect your  future ability to buy these forms of insurance or get the best insurance rates. By New York State Law,  your consent is required for the release of these results to insurance companies. However, you may be  required to release this information to the insurance companies for your contract with them to be valid.     3. Requirement for further testing: CCGP may identify genetic changes that may require additional testing  to evaluate.  This could result in anxiety, uncertainty, and additional expenses that may or may not be  covered by your insurance.     4. Detection of untreatable conditions. CCGP may identify serious, untreatable genetic conditions. It can  result in unexpected psychological trauma, both for you and your family.

sequencing tests for genetic disorders offered  by the Personalized Genomic Medicine Laboratory of Columbia University  Medical Center     Overview   The human genome contains in excess of 20000 protein coding genes. In a  constantly updated encyclopedia of mendelian human disorders, OMIM, as of October 16,  2012, there are about 3600 phenotypes described in which the molecular basis of the  disease is known. There is also an additional 3600 phenotypes listed that have no known  molecular basis to date.  The number of genes described on the site is past 14,000, and  all these genes are thought to be relevant to human disease, although maybe only half of  them have a confirmed role in one or more genetic disorders.    The current paradigm for genetic diagnosis rests on PCR and microarray-based  detection of specific mutations of known significance and/or Sanger sequencing that  allows detection of previously described, as well as novel mutations, in genes that have  been well established to play a role in a specific disease.  These methods work well for  screening for specific mutations or for demonstration of mutations in a small number of  genes, if the gene(s) to test can be largely ascertained based on the clinical phenotype.   However, they fall short in cases where the phenotype and genotype correlation is not  strong enough to efficiently guide the decision-making process as to what mutation in  which gene should be tested for. In cases like congenital hearing loss in which over 100  loci have been implicated, it is often impossible to establish in what order to perform the  review of genes linked to the phenotype.  Even if a more logical phenotype based  approach is available, like in the case of muscular dystrophies, the diagnostic odyssey is  often too painful and expensive to undertake.  Since genetic information is changing at a  rapid pace, clinicians may be unaware of all known genes and, therefore, fail to order the  appropriate tests. NGS allows for simultaneous sequencing of large number of genes that  might carry mutations causing the symptoms of a patient at an affordable price. This  prevents individual clinician bias in testing decisions and improves diagnostic success  rate.    We offer four clinical NGS tests at the Personalized Genomic Medicine Laboratories at  Columbia University Medical Center. These are full mitochondrial genome sequencing  (MGS), the Columbia Combined Genetic Panel (CCGP), whole exome sequencing (WES)  and whole genome sequencing (WGS) tests. The MGS and CCGP tests are for patients  whose disease shows a very characteristic phenotype strongly associated with mutations  in the mitochondrial genome, or in a few dozen candidate genes. The WES and WGS  tests are to be used in situations where one cannot generate a credible list of candidate  genes to be tested. These tests interrogate all coding regions or the entire genome,  respectively. In addition to identifying known disease causing mutations and probable  disease causing mutations in disease associated genes they can also identify entirely  new private mutations in genes previously not linked to the disease.  Confirmation of the  disease causing nature of these novel mutations is based on segregation of the mutation  in families and structural and functional characteristics of the mutation and the gene itself.     th Personalized Genomic Medicine Laboratory  630 West 168  Street  Department of Pathology and Cell Biology  P&S17-401  www.pathology.columbia.edu  New York, NY 10032    Tel: 212-305-9706  OFFICE USE   O :   Fax: 212-342-0420  NLY CCGP sequencing reviewed:  Lab Acc. #:__________    Indication for testing   The presence of a congenital developmental abnormality of presumed genetic  origin   Development of symptoms that suggest the presence of a genetic disorder with  mitochondrial or Mendelian inheritance    Methodology   Hardware: Illumina sequencing instruments: MiSeq for MGS and CCGP tests and  HiSeq2500 for WES and WGS tests.    Capture reagents: We use PCR to capture the mitochondrial genome and Agilent  Sureselect technology to capture the regions of interest (ROI) for the CCGP and  WES studies.  The WGS does not require capture, since the entire genome is  sequenced.    Specimen requirements   All specimens should carry two independent identifiers.    Blood > 300microliters, should be anti-coagulated, preferably with citrate or EDTA  and should be less than a week old.     Muscle biopsy specimens (>50mg) should be refrigerated from the time of biopsy  to arrival to the lab.    DNA should be greater than 10kb median length. We optimally need 3 micrograms  of genomic DNA at concentrations 50-200ng/microliter.

is the columbia combined genetic panel (ccgp) the columbia combined panel is a genetic test that evaluates changes in your dna that might be the cause of your clinical condition. a gene is an individual unit of dna. exons are the most important regions of the gene that provide the instructions for the body to make proteins and chemicals that allow it to function properly. changes in genes, called mutations, can lead to disease. the columbia combined panel tests for exons of many genes at the same time. the genes are chosen based on their known role in disease that cause symptoms like yours. because this test examines a larger portion of the genetic material than traditional tests, it might discover the cause of disease in cases where other tests were inconclusive. because the columbia combined panel is more complicated than prior genetic testing you may have had, the consent and ordering process must be thorough and will be done with the assistance of a genetic counselor and/or your doctor. how is the test done two tubes (two teaspoons) of blood will be collected from you. based on your family tree, your genetic counselor or doctor may also recommend that blood be drawn from two or more members of your family, such as your parents or siblings, to help with interpretation of test results. the genes tested by the ccgp are part of the dna in your blood cells. dna from your blood is purified, and the exome sequence is obtained (or read ) using high throughput sequencing. the sequence obtained for the genes included in the ccgp is then searched for changes that are known or suspected to cause disease. how is this test interpreted once the dna sequence of the exons of the genes of interest is read, the information obtained is analyzed for differences between your sequence and a reference ( normal) sequence. everyone has places in their sequence that are different from the reference. these differences make us unique and usually do not cause medical problems. to determine whether the changes that are found are neutral, or can cause disease, the following steps are taken: first, the variations in your sequence will be compared with a list of mutations that are known to cause medical problems in other people with symptoms similar to yours. subsequently one will examine whether disruptive mutations not previously described are present in genes that are known to cause the type of disease you have. changes found will be compared to the changes seen in your selected family members with or without the disease (if available) to confirm that the changes are indeed the cause of your disease. 2. the primary purpose of the test (why it is being performed). the test is being performed primarily to detect one (or more than one) genetic cause for your condition. the condition you are being tested for is , which causes . the test results may be complex, so you must obtain genetic counseling before signing this consent. th personalized

ccgp sequencing reviewed: lab acc. #: 3. what kinds of results may be obtained, what is their significance for health, and what should you do after receiving the results what kind of results may be reported there are several different kinds of results that may be reported. all results will go directly to your doctor or your other healthcare provider who ordered the test. 1. positive for disease-causing mutation(s): you may have one or more genetic changes that are known to cause a specific genetic condition in other individuals with similar symptoms. the variant or variants would then be called a mutation or mutations and would be interpreted as the cause of your symptoms. 2. no disease causing mutation(s) found: it is possible that the test will not find any genetic change that could explain your symptoms. this type of test result does not mean your condition is not genetic. the result would not take away whatever current diagnoses doctors may have given for your condition. 3. variant with uncertain significance: sometimes the test will find a variation that is predicted to be important, but has not been reported or seen before in people with your condition. such a variant may or may not be the cause of your symptoms. the lab would report it as a variant with uncertain significance if there is evidence strongly suggesting that it is related to your condition. are there any types of results that will not be given to me yes, there are a few types of results that will not be included in the report your doctor gets. 1. mutations that are not directly related to your condition (incidental findings) will not be reported. 2. we might use your relatives samples to help us diagnose your condition, but we will not report results for these individuals. however, your genetic results might have implications for your relatives. it is important that you discuss these implications with your genetic counselor. 3. the dna that will be tested on the sequencer will include genes that are not related to your condition. we will not analyze these genes. therefore, results for these genes will not be available to you or us, and will not be reported. if your doctor decides to test for the other genes in our large panel of genes, he/she will have to order another test. what should i do if there is a positive result this is a test to identify a genetic cause of your clinical condition. if the test is positive for a genetic cause of your clinical condition, you may wish to consult your physician or have further genetic counseling or undergo further independent testing.  (initial) i understand that i have the option to seek further independent testing, and that i should obtain genetic counseling to help me understand the results. are there limitations to the testing yes, there are several limitations to the columbia combined genetic panel: 1. the test will not detect mutations in genes that are not known to be associated with your symptoms. 2. the test report is generated based on current medical knowledge. a mutation that is not known to be the cause of a genetic condition today may be shown to be disease-causing in a year or two. we do not generate updated reports for the test, unless we are requested to do so by the patient. there is a fee th personalized genomic medicine laboratory 630 west 168 street department of pathology and cell biology p&s17-401 www.pathology.columbia.edu new york, ny 10032 tel: 212-305-9706 office use o : fax: 212-342-0420 nly ccgp sequencing reviewed: lab acc. #: associated with providing an updated report. 3. the test is not currently validated to detect large-scale alterations in the dna content of the patient s cells. these include losses or duplications of many genes. another genetic test called microarray is available for this purpose. a microarray test might be ordered by your physician before the ccgp testing. 4. the test may not be able to detect genetic disorders that are caused by expansion of repetitive regions of the genome. one example is fragile x syndrome. if one of these conditions is suspected, your physician should order the appropriate test. 5. the test is not able to detect mutations in the part of the dna that is not part of the exons, (the coding portion of the gene), such as parts of the dna that help regulate gene function. 6. the test may detect findings of uncertain significance, which cannot be proven with complete certainty to be the cause of your condition (see types of results described above). 7. finding a disease-causing mutation may not result in a treatment, cure, or a prognosis (knowledge about how a disease is expected to progress). 8. standard lab limitations caused by human error, such as sample contamination or sample mix-up, may occur but are unlikely.  (initial) i understand the limitations to ccgp 4. when dna testing detects the most common disease-causing changes in a gene, the test result is highly accurate. 5. implications of positive and negative results for your diagnosis predicting the results of the ccgp in advance is not possible. predicting in advance what the results will mean for your health is also not possible. this is due to the fact that many genes are tested and many different positive results can be obtained. each of these different results will have potentially different implications. a negative result (not finding variants) will not change your clinical diagnosis. 6. who will have access to the results the results of the ccgp will become a part of your medical record. test results are stored in the laboratory s computer records, and are normally automatically sent to computerized medical records of new york presbyterian hospital and columbia university. if you do not want these results to be sent to these records, you must inform us about this. unless you tell us not to transmit them, the results will become part of your electronic medical record. even if they do not become part of the electronic medical record, the results may be made available to individuals/organizations with legal access to your medical record, on a strict need-to-know basis. those with legal access include, but are not limited to, the physicians and nursing staff directly involved in your care, the your current and future insurance carriers and others specifically authorized by you or your authorized representative to gain access to your medical records.  (initial) i understand, that the results will be automatically transmitted to my electronic medical records in the nyph and columbia university emrs. i do not object to this. (initial) please do not transmit any of the results to the hospital or university electronic medical records. i understand that the results will continue to be part of the laboratory s electronic information system. if test results are not entered into my hospital or university electronic medical records, future physicians may not have access to those results. i understand that i must assume responsibility for informing my future physicians about findings of ccgp test that affect my healthcare. th personalized genomic medicine laboratory 630 west 168 street department of pathology and cell biology p&s17-401 www.pathology.columbia.edu new york, ny 10032 tel: 212-305-9706 office use o : fax: 212-342-0420 nly ccgp sequencing reviewed: lab acc. #: 7. how long are the ccgp results kept in the testing lab the laboratory will keep the identified ccgp raw data in the lab for 5 years. the final report will be kept as long as possible, at least 5 years. after this, the data from which the final report was generated will be de-identified, and will be stored in a database that does not include any names or other information that would link them back to any individual. however, information about the type of disease and the type of symptoms associated with the genetic findings will be preserved. because this is a new test, it is important to keep track of the types of mutations and variants that are being found in association with particular diseases. this helps us improve our diagnostic capabilities. this might not directly benefit you, but it might benefit future patients with similar conditions. please indicate your choice below.  (initial) i agree to my ccgp data being stored indefinitely in a de-identified way.  (initial) i do not want my ccgp data being stored indefinitely, even if it is de-identified. 8. statement that no additional tests will be performed on this sample, without specific, signed authorization by the patient/legal representative, and that after 60 days, unless consent is given, the sample will be destroyed. --how long are the samples kept in the lab blood and dna samples are normally discarded after 60 days following test completion, unless you provide us consent to store the dna after testing is performed. storing your sample may allow you to request testing in the future without having to obtain a new sample, or to participate in future research, should you wish to do so.  (initial) the laboratory may keep my dna used in my ccgp testing indefinitely should i desire such testing, or if i want to participate in research in the future. i understand that no additional genetic tests will be performed without my specific consent/instructions. the dna may be used only for quality control purposes. there is no guarantee of availability past 60 days. if i decide to participate in research in the future, i will instruct the laboratory, and there will be a requirement of a separate irb-approved consent).  (initial) do not keep my dna used in my ccgp testing linked to information that can identify who i am. i consent to the use of my de-identified dna for quality control purposes or for research in which my identity cannot be determined. i understand that any research using the de-identified dna will require a specific irb approval and oversight.  (initial) please discard dna and other biologic materials used in my ccgp testing, 60 days after all testing is completed. 9. what are the risks of testing 1. identification of familial relationships: ccgp may identify familial relationships other than those originally reported. for example, non-paternity (when the reported father of the child is not the biological father) or half sibling-ships (when siblings do not share the same father and mother) would be detected. you may choose whether or not to be informed of this information, in case it is revealed during the testing. 2. discrimination. the genetic non-discrimination law prevents insurance companies from using your genetic information to deny health insurance coverage. however, the law does not cover life insurance,

insurance or get the best insurance rates. by new york state law, your consent is required for the release of these results to insurance companies. however, you may be required to release this information to the insurance companies for your contract with them to be valid. 3. requirement for further testing: ccgp may identify genetic changes that may require additional testing to evaluate. this could result in anxiety, uncertainty, and additional expenses that may or may not be covered by your insurance. 4. detection of untreatable conditions. ccgp may identify serious, untreatable genetic conditions. it can result in unexpected psychological trauma, both for you and your family. the detection of such a condition could also affect the health or health care needs of your siblings, children, or other close relatives. 10. statement of financial responsibility  (initial) i understand that i, having requested testing to be performed, am responsible for the cost of this testing and will be required to pay for any/all of the test cost if health insurance does not reimburse the laboratory. in addition, if health insurance pays for the test, i understand that the

ccgp sequencing reviewed: lab acc. #: description of high-throughput sequencing tests for genetic disorders offered by the personalized genomic medicine laboratory of columbia university medical center overview the human genome contains in excess of 20000 protein coding genes. in a constantly updated encyclopedia of mendelian human disorders, omim, as of october 16, 2012, there are about 3600 phenotypes described in which the molecular basis of the disease is known. there is also an additional 3600 phenotypes listed that have no known molecular basis to date. the number of genes described on the site is past 14,000, and all these genes are thought to be relevant to human disease, although maybe only half of them have a confirmed role in one or more genetic disorders. the current paradigm for genetic diagnosis rests on pcr and microarray-based detection of specific mutations of known significance and/or sanger sequencing that allows detection of previously described, as well as novel mutations, in genes that have been well established to play a role in a specific disease. these methods work well for screening for specific mutations or for demonstration of mutations in a small number of genes, if the gene(s) to test can be largely ascertained based on the clinical phenotype. however, they fall short in cases where the phenotype and genotype correlation is not strong enough to efficiently guide the decision-making process as to what mutation in which gene should be tested for. in cases like congenital hearing loss in which over 100 loci have been implicated, it is often impossible to establish in what order to perform the review of genes linked to the phenotype. even if a more logical phenotype based approach is available, like in the case of muscular dystrophies, the diagnostic odyssey is often too painful and expensive to undertake. since genetic information is changing at a rapid pace, clinicians may be unaware of all known genes and, therefore, fail to order the appropriate tests. ngs allows for simultaneous sequencing of large number of genes that might carry mutations causing the symptoms of a patient at an affordable price. this prevents individual clinician bias in testing decisions and improves diagnostic success rate. we offer four clinical ngs tests at the personalized genomic medicine laboratories at columbia university medical center. these are full mitochondrial genome sequencing (mgs), the columbia combined genetic panel (ccgp), whole exome sequencing (wes) and whole genome sequencing (wgs) tests. the mgs and ccgp tests are for patients whose disease shows a very characteristic phenotype strongly associated with mutations in the mitochondrial genome, or in a few dozen candidate genes. the wes and wgs tests are to be used in situations where one cannot generate a credible list of candidate genes to be tested. these tests interrogate all coding regions or the entire genome, respectively. in addition to identifying known disease causing mutations and probable disease causing mutations in disease associated genes they can also identify entirely new private mutations in genes previously not linked to the disease. confirmation of the disease causing nature of these novel mutations is based on segregation of the mutation in families and structural and functional characteristics of the mutation and the gene itself. th personalized genomic medicine laboratory 630 west 168 street department of pathology and cell biology p&s17-401 www.pathology.columbia.edu new york, ny 10032 tel: 212-305-9706 office use o

suggest the presence of a genetic disorder with mitochondrial or mendelian inheritance methodology hardware: illumina sequencing instruments: miseq for mgs and ccgp tests and hiseq2500 for wes and wgs tests. capture reagents: we use pcr to capture the mitochondrial genome and agilent sureselect technology to capture the regions of interest (roi) for the ccgp and wes studies. the wgs does not require capture, since the entire genome is sequenced. specimen requirements all specimens should carry two independent identifiers. blood > 300microliters, should be anti-coagulated, preferably with citrate or edta and should be less than a week old. muscle biopsy specimens (>50mg) should be refrigerated from the time of biopsy to arrival to the lab. dna should be greater than 10kb median length. we optimally need 3 micrograms of genomic dna at concentrations 50-200ng/microliter.","['th personalized genomic medicine laboratory 630 west 168 street department of pathology and cell biology', 'p

2019-05-13,../data//Consent_UF_Biorepository,../data//Consent_UF_Biorepository.txt,"Study ID:IRB201500981   Date Approved: 4/29/2016   Expiration Date: 4/28/2017 INFORMED CONSENT FORM to Participate in Research, and AUTHORIZATION  to Collect, Use, and Disclose Protected  Health Information (PHI) Dr Krista Vandenborne is asking permission from you/your child, __________________________________________________________________  Printed name of study participant (“study subject”) to store some of your blood, urine, saliva samples, and any MRI/MRS data. The Principal Investigator (the person in charge of this research) or a representative of  the Principal Investigator will describe this tissue and data bank to you and answer all of  your questions.  Your participation is entirely voluntary.  Before you decide whether or not  to take part, please read the information below and ask questions about anything you do  not understand.  If you choose not to participate in this study you will not be penalized or  lose any benefits that you would otherwise be entitled to. 1. What are we asking to store? If you agree, the following will be collected and stored in the tissue and data bank. We are  requesting that blood, urine, saliva samples, and any MRI/MRS data taken as part of any  ImagingDMD study be stored in the University of Florida Biorepository.  2. Reason for Storing Your Tissue and data: We wish to store your blood, urine, saliva samples and MRI/MRS data and potentially use  it in future research. Because the nature and value of any future testing or research  cannot be known at this time, this genetic information and any other results obtained from  using your tissue and data may not be given to you or your doctor.  There are many different kinds of research uses for these samples and data. Some  researchers may develop new tests to find diseases. Others may develop new ways to  treat or even cure diseases. In the future, some of the research may help to develop new  products, such as tests and drugs. Some research looks at diseases that are passed on  in families (called genetic research). Research done with your blood, urine, saliva  samples and MRI/MRS data may look for genetic causes and signs of disease. IRB Project #IRB201500981 Page 1 of 6 IRB Version:  05/29/2014 PI Version:  2/25/2016 Study ID:IRB201500981   Date Approved: 4/29/2016   Expiration Date: 4/28/2017 Many medical problems may arise due to the environment or from genetic factors. Your  medical condition may come from one or both of these causes. Genetic factors are those  that people are born with and that can affect other family members.  There may be  genetic testing done in the future that would provide information about traits that were  passed on to you from your parents or from you to your children. Because the nature and  value of any future testing or research cannot be known at this time, this genetic  information and any other results obtained from using your tissue and data may not be  given to you or your doctor.  Tests done only for research purposes will not be evaluated or used to diagnose or treat  any of your medical problems. This/these test(s) may need to be repeated if required for  your medical care in the future. 3. Can you change your mind? If you decide that your tissue and data can be kept for future research but you later  change your mind, you can contact Dr Krista Vandenborne at 352-474-0329 or contact  the research coordinator Claudia Senesac at 352-273-6453  who will remove and destroy  any of your tissue samples and /or MRI/MRS data that he/she still has.  Otherwise, the  samples may be kept until they are used up, or until the University of Florida decides to  destroy them. You have the right to see and copy the information that is collected from  you and stored in the tissue and data bank. There will be no cost to you for any tissue or  MRI/MRS data collected and stored. 4. Where will your <medical information \ tissue \ blood sample> be stored? Your tissue samples and MRI/MRS data will be kept in a secure location in a  biorepository called Imaging Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy Biorepository so that it may  be used in future research to learn more about your medical condition and other medical  problems. Once collected, you may be called from time to time to update information on  your health that is necessary to keep the tissue and/or data.  5. Are there any benefits to your participation in this tissue and data bank? There is no direct benefit for your participation in this tissue and data bank.  Even though  the research that is done on your tissue samples and/or MRI/MRS data cannot be used to  help you, it might help other people who have a similar medical condition or other medical  problems. 6. Are there any risks to your participation in this tissue and databank? There are no known risks to storing your tissue samples and MRI/MRS data in the  Biorepository. However the risks of drawing blood from a vein include discomfort at the  site of puncture; possible bruising and swelling around the puncture site; rarely an  infection; and, uncommonly faintness from the procedure. There are no known risks to  collecting urine or saliva samples. IRB Project #IRB201500981 Page 2 of 6 IRB Version:  05/29/2014 PI Version:  2/25/2016 Study ID:IRB201500981   Date Approved: 4/29/2016   Expiration Date: 4/28/2017 MRS and MRI are not known to harm living systems. Imaging is used routinely for  medical care and is very safe for most people, but you will be monitored during the entire  MR scan in case any problems occur.   However, the possibility of unforeseen hazards  cannot be ruled out. The risks of MRI are: •    The MRI scanner contains a very strong magnet.  Therefore, you may not be  able to have the MRI if you have any type of metal implanted in your body, for  example, any pacing device (such as a heart pacer), any metal in your eyes,  or certain types of heart valves or brain aneurysm clips.  Someone will ask you  questions about this before you have the MRI. •   There is not much room inside the MRI scanner.  You may be uncomfortable if  you do not like to be in close spaces (""claustrophobia"").  During the procedure,  you will be able to talk with the MRI staff through a speaker system, and, in the  event of an emergency, you can tell them to stop the scan •   The MRI scanner produces a loud hammering noise, which has produced  hearing loss in a very small number of patients.  You will be given earplugs  and a headphone set to reduce this risk. Although every effort will be made to keep your information confidential, there is a small  risk that an unauthorized person may obtain your information. Therefore, there is a very  slight risk that a test result could be linked to your identity and inadvertently disclosed to a  third party.   If you were to receive the result of a genetic test that indicated a problem, it could cause  anxiety or other psychological distress.  In addition, you might have to decide whether or  not to discuss the findings with members of your family.  If a third party learned the  results, there is a risk of social stigma and of the unpredicted disclosure of this  information to others.  There is a Federal law, called the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA),  that makes it illegal for health insurance companies, group health plans, and most  employers to discriminate against you based on your genetic information.  Additional  information can be obtained at: http://irb.ufl.edu/gina.html or call 1-800-669-3362.  If you  think this law has been violated, it will be up to you to pursue any compensation from  the offending insurance company and/or employer. 7. Will your tissue and data be shared with others? Dr Krista Vandenborne and/or other research staff directly connected with this study or  their successors will be allowed to collect, use and/or give out your tissue samples and  MRI/MRS data. They may give your tissue and MRI/MRS data  to other researchers  whose research is approved by an Institutional Review Board (IRB) (An IRB is a group  of people who are responsible for looking after the rights and welfare of people taking  part in research).  They may also give your medical information \ tissue to a study  sponsor, the Food and Drug Administration, the Department of Health and Human  Services, the Office of Human Research Protections, or other Government agencies.   IRB Project #IRB201500981 Page 3 of 6 IRB Version:  05/29/2014 PI Version:  2/25/2016 Study ID:IRB201500981   Date Approved: 4/29/2016   Expiration Date: 4/28/2017 Your blood, urine, saliva samples and MRI/MRS data may be shared with other  research centers or private companies, in which case the University of Florida may  charge the research center or private company a fee in order to recover the University  of Florida’s costs of sharing your tissue and/ or MRI/MRS data. There is a risk that  information received by these authorized persons or agencies could then be passed on to  others beyond your authorization and not covered by the law.   8. How will the researchers benefit? In general, presenting research results helps the career of a scientist.  Therefore, the  Principal Investigator may benefit if the results of this study are presented at scientific  meetings or in scientific journals. It is possible that new treatments, medicines, therapies  or products could be created from studies that use your tissue or medical information. If  that happens, the Principal Investigator and the University of Florida could receive  significant financial benefits. You will not be offered any payment or any other financial  benefit. 9. If you choose to take part in this study, will it cost you anything? Study Services The Sponsor will pay for all services required as part of your participation in this study.  There will be no cost to you. If you receive a bill related to this study, please contact Dr.  Krista Vandenborne at 352-474-0329. Items/Services Not Paid for by the Sponsor  All other medical services provided to you that are not directly required by this study will  be billed to you or your insurance company in the usual manner.  10. What if you are injured because of the research study?   If you are injured as a direct result of your participation in this study, only the  professional services that you receive from any University of Florida Health Science  Center healthcare provider will be provided without charge.  These healthcare providers  include physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, dentists or psychologists.  Any other expenses, including Shands hospital expenses, will be billed to you or your  insurance provider.  You will be responsible for any deductible, co-insurance, or co-payments. Some  insurance companies may not cover costs associated with research studies or  research-related injuries. Please contact your insurance company for additional  information.  The Principal Investigator will determine whether your injury is related to your  participation in this study.

child,  printed name of study participant ( study subject ) to store some of your blood, urine, saliva samples, and any mri/mrs data. the principal investigator (the person in charge of this research) or a representative of the principal investigator will describe this tissue and data bank to you and answer all of your questions. your participation is entirely voluntary. before you decide whether or not to take part, please read the information below and ask questions about anything you do not understand. if you choose not to participate in this study you will not be penalized or lose any benefits that you would otherwise be entitled to. 1. what are we asking to store if you agree, the following will be collected and stored in the tissue and data bank. we are requesting that blood, urine, saliva samples, and any mri/mrs data taken as part of any imagingdmd study be stored in the university of florida biorepository. 2. reason for storing your tissue and data: we wish to store your blood, urine, saliva samples and mri/mrs data and potentially use it in future research. because the nature and value of any future testing or research cannot be known at this time, this genetic information and any other results obtained from using your tissue and data may not be given to you or your doctor. there are many different kinds of research uses for these samples and data. some researchers may develop new tests to find diseases. others may develop new ways to treat or even cure diseases. in the future, some of the research may help to develop new products, such as tests and drugs. some research looks at diseases that are passed on in families (called genetic research). research done with your blood, urine, saliva samples and mri/mrs data may look for genetic causes and signs of disease. irb project #irb201500981 page 1 of 6 irb version: 05/29/2014 pi version: 2/25/2016 study id:irb201500981 date approved: 4/29/2016 expiration date: 4/28/2017 many medical problems may arise due to the environment or from genetic factors. your medical condition may come from one or both of these causes. genetic factors are those that people are born with and that can affect other family members. there may be genetic testing done in the future that would provide information about traits that were passed on to you from your parents or from you to your children. because the nature and value of any future testing or research cannot be known at this time, this genetic information and any other results obtained from using your tissue and data may not be given to you or your doctor. tests done only for research purposes will not be evaluated or used to diagnose or treat any of your medical problems. this/these test(s) may need to be repeated if required for your medical care in the future. 3. can you change your mind if you decide that your tissue and data can be kept for future research but you later change your mind, you can contact dr krista vandenborne at 352-474-0329 or contact the research coordinator claudia senesac at 352-273-6453 who will remove and destroy any of your tissue samples and /or mri/mrs data that he/she still has. otherwise, the samples may be kept until they are used up, or until the university of florida decides to destroy them. you have the right to see and copy the information that is collected from you and stored in the tissue and data bank. there will be no cost to you for any tissue or mri/mrs data collected and stored. 4. where will your <medical information \ tissue \ blood sample> be stored your tissue samples and mri/mrs data will be kept in a secure location in a biorepository called imaging duchenne muscular dystrophy biorepository so that it may be used in future research to learn more about your medical condition and other medical problems. once collected, you may be called from time to time to update information on your health that is necessary to keep the tissue and/or data. 5. are there any benefits to your participation in this tissue and data bank there is no direct benefit for your participation in this tissue and data bank. even though the research that is done on your tissue samples and/or mri/mrs data cannot be used to help you, it might help other people who have a similar medical condition or other medical problems. 6. are there any risks to your participation in this tissue and databank there are no known risks to storing your tissue samples and mri/mrs data in the biorepository. however the risks of drawing blood from a vein include discomfort at the site of puncture; possible bruising and swelling around the puncture site; rarely an infection; and, uncommonly faintness from the procedure. there are no known risks to collecting urine or saliva samples. irb project #irb201500981 page 2 of 6 irb version: 05/29/2014 pi version: 2/25/2016 study id:irb201500981 date approved: 4/29/2016 expiration date: 4/28/2017 mrs and mri are not known to harm living systems. imaging is used routinely for medical care and is very safe for most people, but you will be monitored during the entire mr scan in case any problems occur. however, the possibility of unforeseen hazards cannot be ruled out. the risks of mri are: the mri scanner contains a very strong magnet. therefore, you may not be able to have the mri if you have any type of metal implanted in your body, for example, any pacing device (such as a heart pacer), any metal in your eyes, or certain types of heart valves or brain aneurysm clips. someone will ask you questions about this before you have the mri. there is not much room inside the mri scanner. you may be uncomfortable if you do not like to be in close spaces (""claustrophobia""). during the procedure, you will be able to talk with the mri staff through a speaker system, and, in the event of an emergency, you can tell them to stop the scan the mri scanner produces a loud hammering noise, which has produced hearing loss in a very small number of patients. you will be given earplugs and a headphone set to reduce this risk. although every effort will be made to keep your information confidential, there is a small risk that an unauthorized person may obtain your information. therefore, there is a very slight risk that a test result could be linked to your identity and inadvertently disclosed to a third party. if you were to receive the result of a genetic test that indicated a problem, it could cause anxiety or other psychological distress. in addition, you might have to decide whether or not to discuss the findings with members of your family. if a third party learned the results, there is a risk of social stigma and of the unpredicted disclosure of this information to others. there is a federal law, called the genetic information nondiscrimination act (gina), that makes it illegal for health insurance companies, group health plans, and most employers to discriminate against you based on your genetic information. additional information can be obtained at: http://irb.ufl.edu/gina.html or call 1-800-669-3362. if you think this law has been violated, it will be up to you to pursue any compensation from the offending insurance company and/or employer. 7. will your tissue and data be shared with others dr krista vandenborne and/or other research staff directly connected with this study or their successors will be allowed to collect, use and/or give out your tissue samples and mri/mrs data. they may give your tissue and mri/mrs data to other researchers whose research is approved by an institutional review board (irb) (an irb is a group of people who are responsible for looking after the rights and welfare of people taking part in research). they may also give your medical information \ tissue to a study sponsor, the food and drug administration, the department of health and human services, the office of human research protections, or other government agencies. irb project #irb201500981 page 3 of 6 irb version: 05/29/2014 pi version: 2/25/2016 study id:irb201500981 date approved: 4/29/2016 expiration date: 4/28/2017 your blood, urine, saliva samples and mri/mrs data may be shared with other research centers or private companies, in which case the university of florida may charge the research center or private company a fee in order to recover the university of florida s costs of sharing your tissue and/ or mri/mrs data. there is a risk that information received by these authorized persons or agencies could then be passed on to others beyond your authorization and not covered by the law. 8. how will the researchers benefit in general, presenting research results helps the career of a scientist. therefore, the principal investigator may benefit if the results of this study are presented at scientific meetings or in scientific journals. it is possible that new treatments, medicines, therapies or products could be created from studies that use your tissue or medical information. if that happens, the principal investigator and the university of florida could receive significant financial benefits. you will not be offered any payment or any other financial benefit. 9. if you choose to take part in this study, will it cost you anything study services the sponsor will pay for all services required as part of your participation in this study. there will be no cost to you. if you receive a bill related to this study, please contact dr. krista vandenborne at 352-474-0329. items/services not paid for by the sponsor all other medical services provided to you that are not directly required by this study will be billed to you or your insurance company in the usual manner. 10. what if you are injured because of the research study if you are injured as a direct result of your participation in this study, only the professional services that you receive from any university of florida health science center healthcare provider will be provided without charge. these healthcare providers include physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, dentists or psychologists. any other expenses, including shands hospital expenses, will be billed to you or your insurance provider. you will be responsible for any deductible, co-insurance, or co-payments. some insurance companies may not cover costs associated with research studies or research-related injuries. please contact your insurance company for additional information. the principal investigator will determine whether your injury is related to your participation in this study. irb project #irb201500981 page 4 of 6 irb version: 05/29/2014 pi version: 2/25/2016 study id:irb201500981 date approved: 4/29/2016 expiration date: 4/28/2017 no additional compensation is routinely offered. the principal investigator and others involved in this study may be university of florida employees. as employees of the university, they are protected under state law, which limits financial recovery for negligence. please contact one of the research team members listed in question 3 of this form if you experience an injury or have questions about any discomforts that you

Please read this form with care and ask any questions  you may have about this study. Your questions will be answered. Also, you will be given a copy of this consent form.       You do not have to be in this research study. You can stop being in this study at any time.  If we learn something new that may  affect the risks or benefits of this study, you will be told so that you can decide whether or not you still want to be in this study.  Your medical record will contain a note saying you are in a research study. Anyone you authorize to receive your medical  record will also get this note.        1. What is the purpose of this study?     You are being asked to be in this research study to better understand how genetic information may affect medical care of  patients.     The purpose of this study is to look at genes (DNA) and how they affect health and disease. Genes are the instruction  manual for your body. The genes you get from your parents decide what you look like and how your body behaves. They  can also tell us a person’s risk for certain diseases and how they will respond to treatment. There are differences in the  DNA between people. These differences are called genetic variants.     You are being asked to provide a blood sample so Vanderbilt researchers can study your DNA to find out if you have  genetic variants that may play a role in how your body responds to certain medications. In this study, we are interested in  genetic variants that may:        affect whether some people need a lower or higher dose of certain medications       affect whether some people are at an increased risk of side effects from certain medications    By doing this study, we are developing a way to use this information in a person’s medical record. We also hope to identify  new genetic variants related to how people’s bodies respond to certain medications    2. What will happen and how long will you be in the study?    If you agree to be in this study, you will be asked to come to the Vanderbilt Clinic to meet with the research coordinator to  discuss the research project. After all of your questions have been answered about the research studyt, if you wish to be in  the study, we will ask you to sign this form.     You will be asked for a sample of blood. We will take about 1 teaspoon of blood from a vein in your arm. We will take your  DNA from this blood sample. Your DNA and medical information about you from your medical record will be kept for this  study and shared with other researchers. We will continue to look at your medical record in the future to review your health.    If you agree to be in this study some of the genetic information we find will be put in your medical record. The genetic  information that will go into your medical record are genetic variants that have been approved by Vanderbilt’s Pharmacy  and Therapeutics Committee as important in choosing medication dose and use. Any genetic information we find that the  committee decides is not known to be important to medical treatment  will remain in the your research record only and will  not be entered into your medical record. If you do not want your genetic information put in your medical record, you  should not agree to be in this study.      Your blood sample will be processed to get your DNA. The DNA, without any information that will link the DNA to you, will  be sent to a central research lab.   1 of 5  Vanderbilt University Institutional Review Board  Informed Consent Document for Research    Principal Investigator:  Dan M Roden, MD  Revision Date:  10/9/12  Study Title:  eMERGE-PGx  Institution/Hospital: Vanderbilt University       Your samples and medical information about you will be made available to others to use for research. To protect your  privacy, we will not release your name or any information that could link the samples to you.     Your samples may be used to make new products or tests. These may have value and may be developed and owned by  the study staff, Vanderbilt University, and/or others. If this happens, there are no plans to provide money to you.    In the future, we also may:   Ask you to complete questionnaires or be interviewed. You may decide at that time if you want to take part. You  can always say no.      Ask you to check whether any of your family members would like to be in the study. If they agree, we will contact  them directly to speak with them about the study. You and your family members can always say no. Your family will  not be contacted without their permission.     Offer you the chance to be in other studies. You can always say no.     Ask you for additional blood samples. Reasons for a new sample might include that we have used up the first  sample you gave or that we want to run new tests. You can always say no.    3. Costs to you if you take part in this study:     There is no cost to you for taking part in this study.     4. Side effects and risks that you can expect if you take part in this study:  Blood Draw Risks: Drawing blood with a needle in a vein may be painful and may cause bruising, bleeding, or rarely,  infection.  Some people may feel faint.  Confidentiality Risk: As with all research, there is a chance that some of your medical information could be released. We  have methods in place to prevent this from happening.  Genetic Testing: The risks of learning genetic test results may include emotional upset or insurance or job discrimination.   A Federal law, called the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA), makes it illegal for health insurance  companies, group health plans, and most employers to discriminate against you based on your genetic information. This  law will protect you in the following ways:     Health insurance companies and group health plans may not request your genetic information that we get from this  research.   Health insurance companies and group health plans may not use your genetic information when making decisions  regarding your eligibility or premiums.   Employers with 15 or more employees may not use your genetic information when making a decision to hire,  promote, or fire you or when setting the terms of your employment.    All health insurance companies and group health plans must follow this law.    2 of 5  Vanderbilt University Institutional Review Board  Informed Consent Document for Research    Principal Investigator:  Dan M Roden, MD  Revision Date:  10/9/12  Study Title:  eMERGE-PGx  Institution/Hospital: Vanderbilt University     Be aware that this new Federal law doesn’t protect you against genetic discrimination by companies that sell life insurance,  disability insurance, or long-term care insurance.

research study to better understand how genetic information may affect medical care of patients. the purpose of this study is to look at genes (dna) and how they affect health and disease. genes are the instruction manual for your body. the genes you get from your parents decide what you look like and how your body behaves. they can also tell us a person s risk for certain diseases and how they will respond to treatment. there are differences in the dna between people. these differences are called genetic variants. you are being asked to provide a blood sample so vanderbilt researchers can study your dna to find out if you have genetic variants that may play a role in how your body responds to certain medications. in this study, we are interested in genetic variants that may: affect whether some people need a lower or higher dose of certain medications affect whether some people are at an increased risk of side effects from certain medications by doing this study, we are developing a way to use this information in a person s medical record. we also hope to identify new genetic variants related to how people s bodies respond to certain medications 2. what will happen and how long will you be in the study if you agree to be in this study, you will be asked to come to the vanderbilt clinic to meet with the research coordinator to discuss the research project. after all of your questions have been answered about the research studyt, if you wish to be in the study, we will ask you to sign this form. you will be asked for a sample of blood. we will take about 1 teaspoon of blood from a vein in your arm. we will take your dna from this blood sample. your dna and medical information about you from your medical record will be kept for this study and shared with other researchers. we will continue to look at your medical record in the future to review your health. if you agree to be in this study some of the genetic information we find will be put in your medical record. the genetic information that will go into your medical record are genetic variants that have been approved by vanderbilt s pharmacy and therapeutics committee as important in choosing medication dose and use. any genetic information we find that the committee decides is not known to be important to medical treatment will remain in the your research record only and will not be entered into your medical record. if you do not want your genetic information put in your medical record, you should not agree to be in this study. your blood sample will be processed to get your dna. the dna, without any information that will link the dna to you, will be sent to a central research lab. 1 of 5 vanderbilt university institutional review board informed consent document for research principal investigator: dan m roden, md revision date: 10/9/12 study title: emerge-pgx institution/hospital: vanderbilt university your samples and medical information about you will be made available to others to use for research. to protect your privacy, we will not release your name or any information that could link the samples to you. your samples may be used to make new products or tests. these may have value and may be developed and owned by the study staff, vanderbilt university, and/or others. if this happens, there are no plans to provide money to you. in the future, we also may: ask you to complete questionnaires or be interviewed. you may decide at that time if you want to take part. you can always say no. ask you to check whether any of your family members would like to be in the study. if they agree, we will contact them directly to speak with them about the study. you and your family members can always say no. your family will not be contacted without their permission. offer you the chance to be in other studies. you can always say no. ask you for additional blood samples. reasons for a new sample might include that we have used up the first sample you gave or that we want to run new tests. you can always say no. 3. costs to you if you take part in this study: there is no cost to you for taking part in this study. 4. side effects and risks that you can expect if you take part in this study: blood draw risks: drawing blood with a needle in a vein may be painful and may cause bruising, bleeding, or rarely, infection. some people may feel faint. confidentiality risk: as with all research, there is a chance that some of your medical information could be released. we have methods in place to prevent this from happening. genetic testing: the risks of learning genetic test results may include emotional upset or insurance or job discrimination. a federal law, called the genetic information nondiscrimination act (gina), makes it illegal for health insurance companies, group health plans, and most employers to discriminate against you based on your genetic information. this law will protect you in the following ways: health insurance companies and group health plans may not request your genetic information that we get from this research. health insurance companies and group health plans may not use your genetic information when making decisions regarding your eligibility or premiums. employers with 15 or more employees may not use your genetic information when making a decision to hire, promote, or fire you or when setting the terms of your employment. all health insurance companies and group health plans must follow this law. 2 of 5 vanderbilt university institutional review board informed consent document for research

Version Date 12/23/2013 Northwestern University Center for Genetic Medicine  Consent Form and HIPAA Authorization for Research PROTOCOL TITLE:  A Pharmacogenomics Pilot Project in General Internal Medicine PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATORS: Maureen Smith, MS, CGC; Rex Chisholm, PhD SUPPORTED BY:  National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) and the  Northwestern University Center for Genetic Medicine Introduction You are being asked to take part in a research study about genetic testing related to a person’s  response to drugs.    This document has important information about the reason for the study, what you will  do if you choose to be in this study, and the way we would like to use information about  you and your health.    You are asked to be in this study because you get your healthcare from a General Internal  Medicine doctor at Northwestern Medical Faculty Foundation.  You may also be taking  certain medications (clopidogrel, warfarin, or simvastatin) right now or possibly in the  future.  These medications are used for preventing strokes, blood clots, and heart  diseases.  They have FDA recommendations about genetic testing before prescribing.    We will use information from your electronic medical record, such as your age and  medical history, to predict if you may be prescribed one of these medications in the  future.   Why are we doing this study? We want to learn more about genetic differences (or variations) that can be involved in a  person’s response to drugs.  We also want to learn how doctors and patients understand and use  results from genetic tests that determines a person’s response to a medication.   Genetic testing is  usually a blood test.  Your blood will be sent to a laboratory to look at genetic differences in your  DNA that are associated with changes in how drugs work in your body. Genes are the biological  instructions for your body and are made up of DNA. Genes (and DNA) are passed down from  parents to their children. The study of how genetic differences affect a person’s response to drugs  is called pharmacogenetics.   More information about this study can be found in the  accompanying pamphlet.  To accomplish this study, we are doing two things:  1. You will be tested for a few of the genetic changes that are known to be related to how a  person responds to certain medications.  The results from this test will be put in your  medical record with the goal of having your doctor use the results in your health care.   You will learn of your results either by a letter, through your MyChart account, and/or  from your physician.  Physicians have also agreed to be a part of this study.  Both you  and your physician will be asked about their experiences with these results to help us  learn how patients and doctors understand and use results from these types of genetic  tests.   Page 1 of 7 IRB #: STU00072134-MODCR0001 Approved by NU IRB for use on or after 12/26/2014 through 12/21/2015. Version Date 12/23/2013 2. You will also donate a blood sample to help researchers learn more about other genetic  changes that may be important to a person’s response to drugs. Additional testing will be  performed on this sample, and unlike the testing above, results from these tests will be  shared with other researchers and most likely not be returned to you.  No identifying  information about you will be shared with outside researchers. However, as we improve  our knowledge about genes that affect response to drugs, we may decide to share the  additional knowledge about these drugs with you and your doctor. You will have the  option to receive results from this additional testing if they become available during the  study period (now through 2015).  What will you do if you choose to be in this study?  A study coordinator will meet with you at the Northwestern General Internal Medicine Clinic  around the time of your regular doctor’s appointment.  If you prefer, a separate time and location  can be arranged.  The first visit will be approximately 30-40 minutes long.   If you agree to be in this study, you will be asked to do the following things: 1. Complete 4 surveys during this study.  You will complete the first one at our face-to-face  meeting after you sign this form.  The other 3 surveys will be mailed or emailed to you at  approximately 1, 6 and 12 months after you receive the pharmacogenetics test results.   Each survey should take about 20-30 min to complete and will ask about your  expectations and experiences with pharmacogenetics testing. 2. Give about 1 tablespoon (20mls) of blood for genetic testing.   3. Let us put results of your genetic testing such as information related to clopidogrel,  warfarin and simvastatin into your electronic medical record and follow how that  information is used. 4. Let us store your genetic information from the additional genetic testing in a secure  research database for future studies related to genes and drug responses.   5. You will be encouraged to sign up for MyChart, if you have not already done so. You  will not be required to sign up for MyChart to be in this study. 6. Tell us at the end of this form if you would like to be contacted about results from any  additional testing that might be performed.  7. You will receive your pharmacogenomic test results approximately 3 months after giving your  blood sample.  You will then receive your first follow-up survey 1 month after receiving your  results and your final survey 12 months later. This would conclude your participation. What are some of the possible risks and discomforts?  The risks of a blood draw may include pain, a bruise at the point where the blood is  taken, redness and/or swelling of the vein and infection.  There is the potential risk for genetic discrimination.  Having the genetic test results in  your medical record may increase the risk to your privacy.   Your insurance company  may have access to this information, just like they would any other information that is in  your medical record.  The federal Genetics Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA)  of 2008 protects you from discrimination by health insurance companies and employers  (http://www.genome.gov/10002077), and we are careful to protect your privacy.

Version Date 12/23/2013 However, we cannot guarantee that this information will not be used in an unintended  way.    Learning about your genetic risks may cause you anxiety and other psychological  distress.    As with any research study, there is the possibility for breach of confidentiality and loss  of privacy. What are the possible benefits for you?  You may not benefit from genetic testing from this study.  Information from this study may help your doctor make choices about drug options for  you.  It may also help avoid bad side effects.    Taking part in this study may help scientists to better understand the role of genes in the  way a person responds to certain medications.  What other procedures or courses of treatment might be available to you?     You do not have to take part in this research study.  Clinical genetic tests for the  medications included in this study are available.  You may choose to pursue testing on  your own.  If you choose to not participate in this study or do any pharmacogenetic  testing, your doctor will make choices for medications based on the current standards of  care. Are there any financial costs to being in this study?  No, you will not be charged for any costs related to the study.  This includes the blood  draw and the genetic tests.  If you wish to speak to a genetic counselor, you may speak to  a genetic counselor involved in the study for free.  The cost of your regular medical care will be billed to you or to your insurance company  in the usual way. Any follow-up procedures related to your genetic results that your  doctor recommends will be considered part of your regular medical care, and will not be  paid for by the research study.   Will you receive payment for participation in this study?      No, you will not be paid for your participation in this project.    Allowing for the storage and future testing of your tissue and blood samples will involve  no cost to you. Your sample will be used only for research and will not be sold. The  research done with your tissue and blood sample may lead to the development of new  products in the future. No compensation will be given to you now or in the future for the  use of these samples If you have questions or concerns about this research study, who can you call?  You can call us with your questions or concerns.  Maureen Smith is the person in charge of this research study.

This form will give you information to help you decide if you want to be in the study or not. Please read it carefully and ask the researchers to explain anything you don’t understand. We can answer your questions by phone or in person before you make your decision. We are asking you to be in this research because you are in the Adult Changes in Thought (ACT) study. This research is not the same as the ACT study. This is a new study that would use samples and information you already gave to the ACT study. You can stay in the ACT study even if you choose not to be in this research. What is this research about? This research is about genetic differences that can affect health and disease. Genetic differences are passed down in families, like eye color or blood type. These differences may partly explain why some people are more likely to get diseases like diabetes, asthma and dementia. We are doing this study to learn more about the link between genes and common diseases. We hope it will help us find new ways to prevent and treat some of these diseases. It may also help us better understand how genes affect health and healthy aging. «PROJID» Consent Form Page 1 of 6 eMERGE GWA consent December 18, 2009 What will happen if I take part in this research? There are no study visits or blood draws involved in this study. We are only asking you to let us use samples and information from the ACT study, for this and other future research. Your ACT participation will continue as usual. If you decide to be in this research, we will share information about you with our research partners at other institutions. We will share genetic information about you from your ACT blood sample. We will also share health information from your ACT study records and your Group Health medical record, such as: •	Your medical history •	Medicines you have been prescribed •	Lab and other test results •	Behavioral information, for example, whether or not you have ever smoked. We will not give out your name, Group Health number, or any other information that could easily identify you. All your information will be labeled only with a code number. Information about you will also be put in a national databank and used in future research. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is in charge of this databank. First, a lab chosen by the NIH will use your blood sample to analyze your DNA. The genetic information from this analysis and some of your health information will then be stored in the national databank so it can be used in the future. We may also send a part of your sample to other research partners to do genetic tests in their labs. We will not give your name or contact information to the databank or our research partners. How will my samples and health information be used? Group Health and our research partners will use your samples and information to look for genetic factors that might affect health and disease. We plan to study memory and aging and other common conditions, such as cataracts, asthma, high cholesterol, and diabetes. At this time, our research partners are: •	The University of Washington •	The Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center •	The Mayo Clinic . Marshfield Clinic •	Northwestern University •	Vanderbilt University •	The National Human Genome Research Institute. •	The Alzheimer’s Disease Genetics Consortium, led by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania Consent Form Page 2 of 6 eMERGE GWA consent December 18, 2009 We may work with other partners in the future to look at other diseases. We or our partners might use your sample to create a cell line, which would allow additional copies of your genetic material to be made. How will information in the national databank be used? Information in the national databank will be used in future research studies. We don't know in advance what these studies will be about. Only qualified researchers can use information in the national databank. This includes researchers from universities, non-profit organizations, and commercial organizations, such as drug or device companies. Researchers who want to get information from the databank must first get approval from a committee at the NIH. They must also sign a pledge to protect the confidentiality of the information. As of April 2008, the national databank included information from more than 48,000 people, and it continues to grow. Will I get any information back? No. The tests planned now are not likely to tell us anything about your personal health status or the health of your children or relatives. Even if we find a link between genetics and health or disease, we won’t know what it means for individual people or families. Researchers who use information from the national databank won't be able to identify you, so they can't send you their results. Are there any risks to me? The main risk in this research is possible loss of confidentiality. This could affect you if someone stole your samples or test results and gave them to an insurance company or employer. The national databank will not have your name, and nobody can tell just by looking that the information there belongs to you. Likewise, nobody can tell just by looking at your blood sample that it came from you. But, because your genetic information is unique to you. there is a small chance that someone could trace the information back to you. The risk of this happening now is very small. But new advances in science could increase this risk in the future. We may share your age or ethnic information with our research partners and the national databank. Some ethnic information can also be found in your DNA. Future research may find that some genetic differences appear more often in people from certain groups. These differences might also be more common in people with a certain disease. This could result in people from that group being treated differently. Consent Form Page 3 of 6 eMERGE GWA consent December 18, 2009 Are there any benefits? You will not benefit personally from taking part in this research. The knowledge we gain about the way genetic differences affect health and disease may help many people in the future. We hope that this research will give us new ideas for preventing, treating, and curing disease. We have no plans to use this research for commercial purposes. But other researchers may use your information to develop and sell new products. If this happens, there are no plans for you to receive any of the profits. Do I have to be in this research? No. You can choose not to be in this research. Your decision won’t affect your care or benefits at Group Health. You can stay in the ACT study even if you choose not to be in this research. If 1 say yes, can I change my mind? Yes. You can agree to be in the research now and change your mind later. If you change your mind, please let us know by writing to: Dr. Eric B. Larson Group Health Research Institute 1730 Minor Avenue, Suite 1600 Seattle, WA 98101-1448 As soon as we hear from you. we will stop using your information for this study. We will ask our research partners to destroy any samples or information they have about you. We will also ask the N1H to take your information out of the national databank and destroy it. If other researchers have already used your information, the NIH won't be able to get it back from them. They can only destroy what is in the national databank so it can’t be used from that point on. How will you protect my confidentiality? Your health information will be de-identified. This means it won’t include your name, Group Health number, or other information that is usually used to identify you. We w ill label your information only with a code number. We will keep the link between your name and your code number at Group Health and will not share it with other researchers. We will destroy this link by April 30, 2034. Group Health has gotten a Certificate of Confidentiality from the NIH. This allows us to refuse to share any information that might identify you, even if we are asked to by a court of law. It’s not likely that we would ever be asked to give out your identity. But Consent Form Page 4 of 6 eMERGE GWA consent December 18, 2009 because we are sharing some of your information outside of Group Health, we got the Certificate as extra protection. The Certificate doesn’t stop study records from being reviewed by some federal agencies. The NI1T may look at study records to make sure we’re doing the study honestly and safely. The Certificate also doesn't stop you from sharing information about yourself or your part in this research. Except for that described in this paragraph, we have no plans to share your name or other identifying information without your consent. The one exception is your genetic information, which is unique to you. At this time it would be very difficult for someone to identify you only from your genetic information, though new advances in science could increase this risk in the future. Privacy information Your health information is protected by a federal privacy law' called H1PAA. This law applies to health care organizations and their employees. This law may not apply to researchers at other institutions. The researchers at Group Health, the University of Washington, and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center will use your health information only for research. We will not share information that identifies you with anyone else except as provided by law. Unless you change your mind, we plan to keep your health information indefinitely. This means we can keep using your information for research unless you change your mind and let us know. Who do I call if 1 have questions? We welcome any questions you may have now and in the future. Please feel free to contact the researchers or their staff at any time. If you have general questions about this research, please call the study telephone number at 1-888-268-6507.

if you change your mind, please let us know by writing to: dr. eric b. larson group health research institute 1730 minor avenue, suite 1600 seattle, wa 98101-1448 as soon as we hear from you. we will stop using your information for this study. we will ask our research partners to destroy any samples or information they have about you. we will also ask the n1h to take your information out of the national databank and destroy it. if other researchers have already used your information, the nih won't be able to get it back from them. they can only destroy what is in the national databank so it can t be used from that point on. how will you protect my confidentiality your health information will be de-identified. this means it won t include your name, group health number, or other information that is usually used to identify you. we w ill label your information only with a code number. we will keep the link between your name and your code number at group health and will not share it with other researchers. we will destroy this link by april 30, 2034. group health has gotten a certificate of confidentiality from the nih. this allows us to refuse to share any information that might identify you, even if we are asked to by a court of law. it s not likely that we would ever be asked to give out your identity. but consent form page 4 of 6 emerge gwa consent december 18, 2009 because we are sharing some of your information outside of group health, we got the certificate as extra protection. the certificate doesn t stop study records from being reviewed by some federal agencies. the ni1t may look at study records to make sure we re doing the study honestly and safely. the certificate also doesn't stop you from sharing information about yourself or your part in this research. except for that described in this paragraph, we have no plans to share your name or other identifying information without your consent. the one exception is your genetic information, which is unique to you. at this time it would be very difficult for someone to identify you only from your genetic information, though new advances in science could increase this risk in the future. privacy information your health information is protected by a federal privacy law' called h1paa. this law applies to health care organizations and their employees. this law may not apply to researchers at other institutions. the researchers at group health, the university of washington, and the fred hutchinson cancer research center will use your health information only for research. we will not share information that identifies you with anyone else except as provided by law. unless you change your mind, we plan to keep your health information indefinitely. this means we can keep using your information for research unless you change your mind and let us know. who do i call if 1 have questions we welcome any questions you may have now and in the future. please feel free to contact the

You have been asked to participate in this research because you are over the age of 50, you receive your vision care at Essentia Health and you don’t have age-related macular degeneration. The goal is to enroll 100 people in this research project.  Why is this research being done?  This research is being done to better understand how genetic information can affect medical care of patients. Specifically, we are looking at how genetic information about risk of age-related macular degeneration affects health care and personal behavior.  What will happen if you agree to participate in the study?  If you agree to be part of this study, you will be asked to do the following things:     1. Meet with research staff to discuss the project in depth and sign the consent form.    2. Complete a short questionnaire about smoking history and family history of age-related       macular degeneration.    3. Provide a sample of blood (about 2 tablespoons). DNA will be extracted from this blood       sample. A sample of your DNA (labeled with a number, not your name) will be sent to an       outside lab to test for genetic markers that predict risk of age-related macular degeneration.    4. Meet with Dr. Fuchs to discuss the genetic test results. The genetic test results will become a       permanent part of your medical record.    5. Allow access to your medical record by research staff.    6. Participate in a brief telephone survey with research staff approximately one month after       receiving your genetic test results. Staff will ask you questions about your reaction to the       genetic testing.                                                   Page 1 of 4 What are the possible risks and discomforts from being in this study?  Genetic testing requires DNA from a blood sample. There is always a risk from having blood taken from a vein. This blood draw will not be different than for your normal clinical labs. Risks associated with blood draws include the potential for minor pain and slight bruising. There is a small chance of infection at the site where the blood was drawn. Some people might faint when their blood is drawn.  What are the possible benefits from being in this research study?  Your genetic test results may help you and your study doctor make more informed decisions about your health care.  How long will you be in this research study?  There is no specific end date for this study. This study will build resources at Essentia Health to incorporate genetic information into clinical care. This information will be placed in your medical records for your doctor to be able to use for your future medical care. You are agreeing to be part of ongoing research about genetics and macular degeneration at Essentia Health. Although there is no planned end date for the research, your time in this part of the study is planned to be done after a telephone interview about your experience with genetic testing.  Will there be a cost to take part in this research study?  Neither you nor your health insurance company will have to pay for any of the genetic testing.  Will you be paid for taking part in this research study?  You will be paid $25 for participation in this project. A check will be sent to you after the final follow- up phone call.  How will information about you and your participation be kept confidential?  Your medical information will be kept as confidential as possible within the limits of the law. Your medical information may be given out if required by law. The results of this study may be published in medical journals or presented at scientific meetings. You will not be identified by name, picture or any other personally identifying information.  The results of the genetic testing will be included in your medical record and protected in the same way that other information in your medical record is protected by Essentia Health policies.  The Genetic Information Non-Discrimination Act (GINA) is a Federal law that applies to health insurance companies, group health plans and employers with more than 15 employees. Under the terms of GINA, these groups may not: request genetic information collected as part of a research                                                    Page 2 of 4 project, use your genetic information when making decision about your insurance eligibility or premiums, or use genetic information from research when making employment decisions. GINA does not protect against discrimination by companies that sell life insurance, disability insurance or long- term care insurance.  What happens if you become ill or injured from this study?  You will get medical treatment if you are injured as a result of taking part in this study. You and/or your health plan will be charged for the treatment of an injury. The study will not pay for any medical treatment.  What do you do if you want to withdraw from the study?  Taking part in research is voluntary. You have the right to withdraw your participation at any time. If you withdraw, your remaining DNA will be destroyed. If your sample and information have already been used in research, it would not be possible to remove the information that has learned prior to your request to withdraw. If you want to take back your consent, call Dr. McCarty at 218-786-2128.  Who can I contact for more information on this research?  For more information or to report injuries, you may contact Dr. Cathy McCarty, Essentia Institute of Rural Health, at 218-786-2128; or Dr. Michael Fuchs, Essentia Health, at 218-786-3937.  What are my rights if I take part in this research?  Being in this study is voluntary. If you choose not to sign this consent form, your relationship with your doctor and Essentia Health will not change. You are not giving up any legal rights by signing this consent form and participating in this research study.  Collection/banking of human biological material for future research:  Research staff would like to store some of the DNA from this research project for future research (DNA biobanking). Participation in this DNA biobanking is completely voluntary. You can participate in the genetic testing for age-related macular degeneration without participating in the DNA biobanking. You can change your mind at any time about storage and future use of your DNA. Please read the two statements below and check “yes” or “no” for each one.     1. My DNA may be stored for possible use in future research to learn about prevention, treatment       and cures for age-related macular degeneration.

2019-05-13,../data//Duke-excess-sample-consent-form,../data//Duke-excess-sample-consent-form.txt,"Form M0345          DUKE UNIVERSITY HEALTH SYSTEM          Consent To Participate In A Research Study         DUHS Biospecimen Repository and Processing Core (BRPC)         Facility PI: Shannon McCall, MD         Participant Category: Excess Tissue Collection          This is a consent form for a research project. Your participation is voluntary. If you decide not to         participate in this research project, it will not affect your medical care at Duke. Take your time reading         this form and ask questions. Feel free to talk to your friends and family before you decide whether or         not you want to take part.          WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS PROJECT?         In this research project, we are collecting specimens (things like blood or other tissue) from Duke         patients. We are also collecting patients’ health information. The specimens and health information         will be stored in a biobank for researchers to study to learn more about health and disease. A biobank is         like a research library, full of specimens and information for researchers to use in their work.         This biobank is called the Duke Biospecimen Repository and Processing Core (or just the ‘Biobank’ in         the rest of this form). We are asking you to take part because you are being seen by a health care         provider at Duke University Health System. About 600 patients take part in the Biobank each year.          WILL MY MEDICAL CARE CHANGE IF I TAKE PART IN THIS PROJECT?         Your medical care will not change. You will see your same doctors at Duke and your treatment will be         the same whether you take part or not.          WHO IS IN CHARGE OF THIS PROJECT?         Dr. Shannon McCall is in charge of the Biobank. The Biobank pays part of her salary and also for her         team. The Biobank is part of the Duke School of Medicine and the Duke Cancer Institute.          WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF I TAKE PART IN THIS PROJECT?         1. We will get one or more specimens from you. If your doctor removes tissue from you            (during surgery, for example), the tissue is tested and used to plan your medical care. The            tissue collected is what is needed for your care. Your doctor keeps some tissue for future            tests or second opinions. If there is tissue leftover after this, we would like to store this            remaining tissue in the Biobank. If you come back to Duke in the future, we would like to            collect and store any leftover tissue at that time, too. If there is no leftover tissue from a            procedure, the Biobank will not take tissue needed for your care. These collections do not            take extra tissue from your body.         2. We will get some information about you and your health. We will ask for information            about you, such as your age and race or ethnicity, as well as other things about your health,            like test results and the medicines you take. We will collect information from your Duke            medical record from time to time to update this information. This will happen for as long as            your information is stored in the Biobank.           Protocol ID: Pro00035974         Continuing Review Before: 3/15/2016         Reference Date: 2/25/2015                Page 1 of 6                           Subject Initials: Form M0345          DUKE UNIVERSITY HEALTH SYSTEM          Consent To Participate In A Research Study         DUHS Biospecimen Repository and Processing Core (BRPC)         Facility PI: Shannon McCall, MD         Participant Category: Excess Tissue Collection          3. We will store your specimen(s) and information. Your materials will be stored in the            Biobank, along with those from all the other people who take part. There is no limit on the            length of time we will keep them. We will keep them for as long as they are useful for            research, unless you decide to stop taking part or we close the Biobank.         4. We may look for and use leftover tissue from any procedures you have had in the past.            Clinical laboratories are required to store some leftover sample for possible future testing            needed for your care. If there is more sample leftover than the lab expects to use in your            future care, this excess material may be used in the Biobank. We may ask for these excess            samples from the Duke pathology laboratory or from an outside pathology laboratory.         5. We will let researchers study the materials stored in the Biobank. Through these studies,            researchers hope to find new ways to detect, treat, prevent, or cure health problems. Some of these            studies will be about how genes affect health, or how genes affect response to treatment. (Genes            give the instructions for building proteins that make our bodies work. Genes are made of DNA,            which stores information in the form of a code that you inherit from your parents and that you pass            on to your children.) Some studies may lead to new products, such as drugs or tests for diseases.            Materials stored in the Biobank will mainly be studied by Duke researchers. Researchers at other            hospitals, the government, and drug- or health-related companies can apply to study your specimens.            Each application will be reviewed by a science committee at Duke that reports to the Biobank. An            ethics review will also be done. This kind of review is to make sure that risks are minimized and            that the rights and welfare of people who participate in research are protected.            If a study is approved, your sample and some information about your health might be distributed to            the researchers, along with samples and information from many other people. Your information will            be protected as described in the section “How will you keep my information private?”          ARE THERE ANY PARTS OF THIS PROJECT THAT ARE OPTIONAL?         Being in this project means that you agree to let us store your specimens and health information in the         Biobank for use in future research. There are some optional parts of the project explained below. Even         if you don’t agree to any of the next three questions, you can still be in this project. You can change         your mind on any of these options at any time.         1. Blood Draw for Research: If you are not having blood drawn soon for your care, we would like to            perform a special one-time blood draw of about 3 tablespoons (40 mL) for the Biobank. Like any            other time you have blood drawn, you may feel brief pain or have some bruising from the needle.                Do you agree to have a one-time blood draw just for the Biobank?                       Yes _______ (Initials)                       No _______ (Initials)         2. Extra Blood Tubes: We would like to collect about 3 tablespoons (40 mL) of blood when you are          Protocol ID: Pro00035974         Continuing Review Before: 3/15/2016         Reference Date: 2/25/2015              Page 2 of 6                           Subject Initials: Form M0345          DUKE UNIVERSITY HEALTH SYSTEM          Consent To Participate In A Research Study         DUHS Biospecimen Repository and Processing Core (BRPC)         Facility PI: Shannon McCall, MD         Participant Category: Excess Tissue Collection             already having blood drawn for your care. We would collect blood for the Biobank no more than 6            times in a one-year period and no more than once every 8 weeks.                If you have blood drawn for your medical care, can we collect some extra blood at that                same time just for research?                        Yes _______ (Initials)                       No _______ (Initials)         3. Future Contact: Duke Researchers who are studying your materials may want to contact you if they            need more information that is important for their research. Researchers will only be allowed to            contact you if their study is approved by the Duke Institutional Review Board and if you indicate            ‘yes’ below.                Is it okay for Duke Researchers to contact you in the future?                        Yes _______ (Initials)                       No _______ (Initials)          WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF THE PROJECT?         Physical Risks. When you have the test or procedure to remove tissue for your medical care, your         doctor will explain the risks to you at that time, and they may include discomfort, bleeding, bruising,         and scarring. If you agree to a one-time blood draw for the Biobank, you may experience discomfort,         bleeding or bruising associated with that blood draw.         Privacy Risks. The main risk in this project is that someone other than the researchers could get access         to information we have stored about you. If those data suggested something serious about your health, it         could be misused. For example, it could be used to make it harder for you to get or keep a job or         insurance. There are laws against this kind of misuse, including the Federal Genetic Information and         Nondiscrimination Act (GINA), but they may not give full protection. GINA protects your genetic         information in the following ways:                Health insurance companies and group plans may not request genetic information from this                research                Health insurance companies and group plans may not use your genetic information when making                decisions regarding your eligibility or premiums                Employers with 15 or more employees may not use your genetic information when making a                decision to hire, promote, or fire you or when setting the terms of your employment           There may be other unforeseen privacy risks.          Protocol ID: Pro00035974         Continuing Review Before: 3/15/2016         Reference Date: 2/25/2015               Page 3 of 6                           Subject Initials: Form M0345          DUKE UNIVERSITY HEALTH SYSTEM          Consent To Participate In A Research Study         DUHS Biospecimen Repository and Processing Core (BRPC)         Facility PI: Shannon McCall, MD         Participant Category: Excess Tissue Collection          We believe the chance these things will happen is very small, but we cannot make guarantees. Your         privacy and the confidentiality of your data are very important to us and we will make every effort to         protect them. These efforts are described in the next section.          HOW WILL YOU KEEP MY INFORMATION PRIVATE?         Duke follows Federal Privacy Regulations when protecting your research records. We will put a copy         of this consent form in your medical record, but we will keep the rest of your research records separate.         Your name will not be on your samples. All samples are labelled with generic numbers, such as         “Sample 123.” Most researchers who use your specimens and information will never know who you         are. For certain studies, we may give Duke researchers your protected health information, but only if         they get approval from the Duke Institutional Review Board and they show that they have a solid plan to         protect your privacy.         Your records may be reviewed in order to meet federal or state regulations. Reviewers may include         representatives of the Duke University Health System and the Duke University Health System         Institutional Review Board. A reviewer who looks at your research record may also need to look at your         entire medical record. Your information may also be disclosed to outside reviewers such as the Food         and Drug Administration (FDA), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the National Cancer         Institute (NCI) for monitoring purposes. If this happens, it may not be covered by federal patient         privacy rules (called ‘HIPAA’), but it will be protected by other federal privacy rules.          ARE THERE ANY BENEFITS TO TAKING PART IN THIS PROJECT?         You should not expect to get direct health benefits if you decide to participate in the Biobank. The main         reason you may want to participate is to help researchers make discoveries that may benefit people in         the future. You will not be paid for participating in the Biobank.          ARE THERE ANY COSTS OR PAYMENTS?         There are no costs to you for taking part in the Biobank. You or your insurance company is responsible         for your medical bills for your regular care.           We will use your sample only for research. We will not sell it, although researchers may pay the         Biobank to cover the cost of processing and storing specimens. Research using the stored materials         might someday lead to the development of a medical or genetic test, drug, or other commercial product.         You will not receive money from the sale of any such product.         You should not expect to get individual results from research done through the Biobank. Researchers         must study samples and information from many people over many years before they can know if the         results have meaning. We will not give the results to your doctor or put the research results in your          Protocol ID: Pro00035974         Continuing Review Before: 3/15/2016         Reference Date: 2/25/2015               Page 4 of 6                           Subject Initials: Form M0345          DUKE UNIVERSITY HEALTH SYSTEM          Consent To Participate In A Research Study         DUHS Biospecimen Repository and Processing Core (BRPC)         Facility PI: Shannon McCall, MD         Participant Category: Excess Tissue Collection          medical record.         There is a small chance that researchers could discover something that might be very important to your         health or medical care right now. If this happens, and the Biobank staff is made aware of this, we will         try to contact you to see if you want to learn more.         Research is not the same as your medical care. If we do not contact you about your results, do not         assume that means everything is okay. Talk to your doctor if you have any questions or concerns about         your health.          CAN I DECIDE TO NOT TAKE PART OR TO LEAVE THIS PROJECT?         Taking part in the Biobank is voluntary. You can choose whether or not to take part. You can still be in         the Biobank even if you say ‘no’ to the optional parts. If you choose to take part, you can change your         mind at any time. No matter what you decide, now or in the future, it will not affect your medical care.         If you decide to leave the project, please let Dr. McCall know in writing. Her mailing address is Dr.         Shannon McCall, Box 3712, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC 27710. We will not collect         any new information about you, and we will destroy all your remaining specimens. If some of your         specimens and information have already been given out for research, we cannot get them back.          WHOM SHOULD I CALL IF I HAVE QUESTIONS OR PROBLEMS?         For questions about the Biobank or a research-related injury, or if you have complaints, concerns, or         suggestions related to the research, contact Dr. Shannon McCall at (919) 684-2531 during regular         business hours and at (919) 970-6764 after hours and on weekends and holidays.

doctor removes tissue from you (during surgery, for example), the tissue is tested and used to plan your medical care. the tissue collected is what is needed for your care. your doctor keeps some tissue for future tests or second opinions. if there is tissue leftover after this, we would like to store this remaining tissue in the biobank. if you come back to duke in the future, we would like to collect and store any leftover tissue at that time, too. if there is no leftover tissue from a procedure, the biobank will not take tissue needed for your care. these collections do not take extra tissue from your body. 2. we will get some information about you and your health. we will ask for information about you, such as your age and race or ethnicity, as well as other things about your health, like test results and the medicines you take. we will collect information from your duke medical record from time to time to update this information. this will happen for as long as your information is stored in the biobank. protocol id: pro00035974 continuing review before: 3/15/2016 reference date: 2/25/2015 page 1 of 6 subject initials: form m0345 duke university health system consent to participate in a research study duhs biospecimen repository and processing core (brpc) facility pi: shannon mccall, md participant category: excess tissue collection 3. we will store your specimen(s) and information. your materials will be stored in the biobank, along with those from all the other people who take part. there is no limit on the length of time we will keep them. we will keep them for as long as they are useful for research, unless you decide to stop taking part or we close the biobank. 4. we may look for and use leftover tissue from any procedures you have had in the past. clinical laboratories are required to store some leftover sample for possible future testing needed for your care. if there is more sample leftover than the lab expects to use in your future care, this excess material may be used in the biobank. we may ask for these excess samples from the duke pathology laboratory or from an outside pathology laboratory. 5. we will let researchers study the materials stored in the biobank. through these studies, researchers hope to find new ways to detect, treat, prevent, or cure health problems. some of these studies will be about how genes affect health, or how genes affect response to treatment. (genes give the instructions for building proteins that make our bodies work. genes are made of dna, which stores information in the form of a code that you inherit from your parents and that you pass on to your children.) some studies may lead to new products, such as drugs or tests for diseases. materials stored in the biobank will mainly be studied by duke researchers. researchers at other hospitals, the government, and drug- or health-related companies can apply to study your specimens. each application will be reviewed by a science committee at duke that reports to the biobank. an ethics review will also be done. this kind of review is to make sure that risks are minimized and that the rights and welfare of people who participate in research are protected. if a study is approved, your sample and some information about your health might be distributed to the researchers, along with samples and information from many other people. your information will be protected as described in the section how will you keep my information private are there any parts of this project that are optional being in this project means that you agree to let us store your specimens and health information in the biobank for use in future research. there are some optional parts of the project explained below. even if you don t agree to any of the next three questions, you can still be in this project. you can change your mind on any of these options at any time. 1. blood draw for research: if you are not having blood drawn soon for your care, we would like to perform a special one-time blood draw of about 3 tablespoons (40 ml) for the biobank. like any other time you have blood drawn, you may feel brief pain or have some bruising from the needle. do you agree to have a one-time blood draw just for the biobank yes  (initials) no  (initials) 2. extra blood tubes: we would like to collect about 3 tablespoons (40 ml) of blood when you are protocol id: pro00035974

more than 6 times in a one-year period and no more than once every 8 weeks. if you have blood drawn for your medical care, can we collect some extra blood at that same time just for research yes  (initials) no  (initials) 3. future contact: duke researchers who are studying your materials may want to contact you if they need more information that is important for their research. researchers will only be allowed to contact you if their study is approved by the duke institutional review board and if you indicate yes below. is it okay for duke researchers to contact you in the future yes  (initials) no  (initials) what are the risks of the project physical risks. when you have the test or procedure to remove tissue for your medical care, your doctor will explain the risks to you at that time, and they may include discomfort, bleeding, bruising, and scarring. if you agree to a one-time blood draw for the biobank, you may experience discomfort, bleeding or bruising associated with that blood draw. privacy risks. the main risk in this project is that someone other than the researchers could get access to information we have stored about you. if those data suggested something serious about your health, it could be misused. for example, it could be used to make it harder for you to get or keep a job or insurance. there are laws against this kind of misuse, including the federal genetic information and nondiscrimination act (gina), but they may not give full protection. gina protects your genetic information in the following ways: health insurance companies and group plans may not request genetic information from this research health insurance companies and group plans may not use your genetic information when making decisions regarding your eligibility or premiums employers with 15 or more employees may not use your genetic information when making a decision to hire, promote, or fire you or when setting the terms of your employment there may be other unforeseen privacy risks. protocol id: pro00035974 continuing review before: 3/15/2016 reference date: 2/25/2015 page 3 of 6 subject initials: form m0345 duke university health system consent to

who use your specimens and information will never know who you are. for certain studies, we may give duke researchers your protected health information, but only if they get approval from the duke institutional review board and they show that they have a solid plan to protect your privacy. your records may be reviewed in order to meet federal or state regulations. reviewers may include representatives of the duke university health system and the duke university health system institutional review board. a reviewer who looks at your research record may also need to look at your entire medical record. your information may also be disclosed to outside reviewers such as the food and drug administration (fda), the national institutes of health (nih), and the national cancer institute (nci) for monitoring purposes. if this happens, it may not be covered by federal patient privacy rules (called hipaa ), but it will be protected by other federal privacy rules. are there any benefits to taking part in this project you should not expect to get direct health benefits if you decide to participate in the biobank. the main reason you may want to participate is to help researchers make discoveries that may benefit people in the future. you will not be paid for participating in the biobank. are there any costs or payments there are no costs to you for taking part in the biobank. you or your insurance company is responsible for your medical bills for your regular care. we will use your sample only for research. we will not sell it, although researchers may pay the biobank to cover the cost of processing and storing specimens. research using the stored materials might someday lead to the development of a medical or genetic test, drug, or other commercial product. you will not receive money from the sale of any such product. you should not expect to get individual results from research done through the biobank. researchers must study samples and information from many people over many years before they can know if the results have meaning. we will not give the results to your doctor or put the research results in your protocol id: pro00035974 continuing review before:

Please ask the study doctor or the study staff to explain any words or information that you do not clearly understand.  You may print an unsigned copy of this consent form to think about or discuss with family or friends before making your decision.  SUMMARY  You are being asked to be in a research study.  The purpose of this consent form is to help you decide if you want to be in the research study.  Please read this form carefully.  To be in a research study you must give your informed consent.  “Informed consent” includes: · Completing the online tutorial · Reading this consent form, · Asking questions to the investigator or staff about anything that is not clear, and · Printing out an unsigned copy of this consent form.  This gives you time to think about it and to talk to family or friends before you make your decision.  You should not join this research study until all of your questions are answered.  Things to know before deciding to take part in a research study:   · The main goal of a research study is to learn things to help patients in the future. · The main goal of regular medical care is to help each patient. · The decision to join or not join the research study will not cause you to lose any medical benefits.  If you decide not to take part in this study, your doctor will continue to treat you. · After going through the online materials and reading the consent form you should understand the goals of the research study and the risks of taking part in the study. · Any data you contribute such as personal genomic or health data or your medical records may become part of the research record.  If that happens, your data and medical records will be looked at and/or copied by the sponsor of this study and government agencies or other groups associated with the study.   PURPOSE OF THE STUDY  · Traditionally, most scientific research involves selected individuals who volunteer time, contribute samples and data in the name of improving our collective understanding and small groups of researchers who analyze that data and publish their findings in scientific literature. Once the project is over, it’s over, and re-using the data is hard to do. · The purpose of this study is to create a far larger group of participants, to make it far easier to re-use the data again and again, and to allow any volunteer to play an active role in the scientific research process. The study is possible through technical and legal tools that permit participants to broadly share and distribute their data for research purposes, and tools that make it easy for researchers to use your data to improve our common understanding of human genomics and health.  · The experimental components of this study are: o The completion of mixed- media information modules and an online informed consent process. o The provision of personal, genomic and health-related information  o The broad availability of the collected datasets to any interested researcher who have explicitly agreed to the study’s terms and conditions.. · One of the primary aims of the CGR is to build large, open datasets and tools that make it easy for scientists to work together and innovate by utilizing health data. While we believe that promoting public research is crucial to the rapid advancement of scientific and medical knowledge, we also recognize that it carries a unique set of risks and considerations for participants. This document is designed to help you understand those risks and to make an informed choice about whether to participate in Creating a Self-contributed Genomic data cohort/ PLC-CGR  PROCEDURES  · Sage Bionetworks is conducting a study that will collect genomic, phenotypic, observational, health-related and other forms of information from volunteer individuals.  · The information will be owned by the individuals (i.e., already in their possession) and uploaded by electronic means, including websites and software applications.  · The information will be provided by the individuals to the study, and not generated by the study investigators.  · To respect participant’s privacy, unless otherwise requested, information that can directly identify the participant will be removed from the data prior to making it available to researchers.  Information that can directly identify participants are: 1. Names;  2. All geographical subdivisions smaller than a State, including street address, city, county, precinct, zip code, and their equivalent geocodes, except for the initial three digits of a zip code, if according to the current publicly available data from the Bureau of the Census: (1) The geographic unit formed by combining all zip codes with the same three initial digits contains more than 20,000 people; and (2) The initial three digits of a zip code for all such geographic units containing 20,000 or fewer people is changed to 000.  3. All elements of dates (except year) for dates directly related to an individual, including birth date, admission date, discharge date, date of death; and all ages over 89 and all elements of dates (including year) indicative of such age, except that such ages and elements may be aggregated into a single category of age 90 or older;  4. Phone numbers;  5. Fax numbers;  6. Electronic mail addresses;  7. Social Security numbers;  8. Medical record numbers;  9. Health plan beneficiary numbers;  10. Account numbers;  11. Certificate/license numbers;  12. Vehicle identifiers and serial numbers, including license plate numbers;  13. Device identifiers and serial numbers;  14. Web Universal Resource Locators (URLs);  15. Internet Protocol (IP) address numbers;  16. Biometric identifiers, including finger and voice prints;  17. Full face photographic images and any comparable images; and  18. Any other unique identifying number, characteristic, or code (note this does not mean the unique code assigned by the investigator to code the data)    o However, even with removal of these identifying information points, it is sometimes possible to re-identify individuals uniquely given enough information about the individual. This risk should be contemplated prior to enrolling. · Individuals will be assigned a “global unique identifier” (GUID) that will be published alongside their data. The GUID will allow for new data that participants upload to be connected to their old data, or for data that is uploaded from multiple venues to be connected. The GUID will also serve as a mechanism for researchers to send messages to participants without having to reveal the identities of participants. · Data collected will be made available, for research purposes, to a broad variety of users who have agreed to be bound by a contract and to specific terms and conditions that include use of the data in an ethical manner, to do no harm, not re-identify or re-contact individuals, and to make their research results openly available to the general public.  RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS  The main risk of donating your personal, genetic and health-related information is the loss of confidentiality. The following is a non-comprehensive list of scenarios that could pose risks for you and/or your family: · Data that you provide (such as trait data or DNA sequence or other genetic data) may be used to identify you.  This may, among other things, result in contact from the press and other members of the public motivated by positive or negative feelings about one or more studies. This could mean a significant loss of privacy and personal time. · If you enroll in the creation of a Self-Contributed Genomic Data Cohort, it is possible that data not intended to be published (e.g., your name, date of birth, or contact information) will be publicly disclosed due to unintended data breaches, including hacking or other activities outside of the procedures authorized by the study, or may be used for unauthorized purposes despite the restrictions that those using data are required to agree to. Should this occur you would be subject to the various risks and discomforts described in this section and throughout this consent form, and possibly to other risks as well, even though you did not intend for such data to be published or misused. · The public disclosure of your genetic and trait data could cause you to learn – either directly, from a family member or from another individual – certain unexpected genealogical features about you and/or your family. In particular, you might learn things about your genetic features that might cast doubt on paternity in your family. · The public disclosure of your genetic and trait data could allow someone sufficiently skilled in data analysis to reveal to you or a member of your family the possibility of a disease or other trait or propensity for a disease or other trait. · The public disclosure of your genetic and trait data could allow someone sufficiently skilled in data analysis to claim statistical evidence, including with respect to your genetic predisposition to certain diseases or other traits, that could affect the ability of you and/or your family to obtain or maintain employment, insurance or financial services (for example, “your genotype indicates you have a statistically higher probability of prostate cancer, and thus life insurance premiums increase); · Whether or not it is lawful to do so, you could be subject to actual or attempted employment, insurance, financial, or other forms of discrimination or negative treatment due to the public disclosure of your genetic and trait information through this study or by a third party. Although United States law bars certain forms of genetic discrimination (the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, also known as GINA), this law does not apply to the use of genetic information in all circumstances and, even where it does apply, it does not guarantee that your genetic information will not be used against you in a way that you feel is discriminatory or otherwise harmful to you and/or your family. · If you have previously made available or intend to make available genetic or other medical or trait information in a confidential setting, for example in another research study, the data that you provide to the Self-Contributed Genomic Data Cohort may be used, on its own or in combination with your previously shared data, to identify you as a participant in otherwise private and/or confidential research. This means that any data or other information you may have shared pursuant to a promise of confidentiality or privacy may become public despite your intent that they be kept private and confidential. This could result in certain adverse effects for you, including ones not considered or anticipated by this consent form. · Your commonly available DNA sequence data, trait data and other information will include certain information that applies to your family members. Some people may draw conclusions from your commonly available information, including speculating about what such information might reveal about you and your family members. As a result, we cannot predict all of the risks, or the severity of the risks, that the public availability of this information may pose to you and your relatives. You are strongly encouraged to discuss your participation in this study and its potential risks, including the fact that not all of the risks are known, with your immediate family members. · There are some risks that are currently very unlikely, but at least theoretically possible, from sharing your DNA sequence information online. For example, someone could synthesize strings of DNA from your data and place them at a crime scene in an attempt to implicate you.  · Individuals under the age of 21 will not be allowed to participate in the study.  NEW INFORMATION  Participants will be informed via the study website at http://weconsent.us about any new information that might change their decision to continue to be in this study.  You may be asked to sign a new consent form if this occurs.  BENEFITS You are not likely to directly benefit in any way as a result of your participation in the creation of a Self-Contributed Genomic Data Cohort. The benefits will primarily be to society and to science at large. The primary outputs of this study will be published, either in the traditional scientific literature or in newer forms such as blogs, wikis, software models of disease, and more. One of the Terms of Use that we will require of researchers is a commitment to publish their results under “Open Access” terms, which means that the outputs must be freely available on the public internet, permitting any users – including you – to read, download, copy, distribute, print, search, or link to the full texts of these articles without financial, legal, or technical barriers other than those inseparable from gaining access to the internet itself. This is not a direct benefit to you, but to science and society, but through this Open Access requirement you will at least be able to access and read the research emerging from the study without having to pay fees.  This study does not entitle you to demand data return from a biosample you submit in the context of other clinical research, or of data from another study.  COSTS There are no costs to participate in this study.  PAYMENT FOR PARTICIPATION   You will not be compensated for your participation in the study. Neither you nor your heirs will receive financial or any other benefits from any discoveries, whether or not of a commercial nature, made using the information and/or specimens that you provide.  ALTERNATIVE TREATMENT  This is not a treatment study.  Your alternative is not to participate in this study.  CONFIDENTIALITY  Study information collected about you will be given to the sponsor.  “Sponsor” means any persons or companies that are working for or with the sponsor, or owned by the sponsor. It will also be given to qualified researchers, which means any persons who have agreed to be bound by a set of Terms and Conditions of Use in order to access and use your data for research purposes.  It may be given to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or other governmental agencies in the US and other countries where the study may be considered for approval.  Medical records which identify you and the consent form signed by you may be looked at and/or copied for research or regulatory purposes by:  · The FDA, · Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) agencies, · Governmental agencies in other countries, and · Western Institutional Review Board® (WIRB®) or other Institutional Review Board.  Total confidentiality cannot be guaranteed because of the need to give information to these parties.  The results of this research study may be presented at meetings or in publications.  Your identity will not be given out during those presentations.  Why will this information be used and/or given to others? · To create computational models of biology and disease · To replicate studies · To explore the connection between genomes, health, and disease  If the results of this study are made public, information that identifies you will not be used. What if I decide not to give permission to use and give out my health information? Then you will not be able to be in this research study.  May I review or copy my information? Yes, at any time.  May I withdraw or revoke (cancel) my permission? Your permission will not stop automatically.  It will expire in 2080.  You are free to decide at any time that you no longer want your data or other information to be used as part of this study. However, it may not be possible to prevent the future use of your data or other information in certain circumstances. If you choose to withdraw from the study and request that your genetic and trait data be removed, you will send your Unique Identifier to the Principal Investigator and within 2 months we will delete all DNA sequence and trait data about you held in the updated Self-Contributed Genomic Data Cohort and we will take reasonable steps to ensure that the data provided by you previously will not be included in future updates to the Self-contributed Genomic Data Cohort public database.  However, once any data or information about you is posted to the Self-contributed Genomic Data Cohort public database, other organizations and individuals may acquire copies of it. There will be no way to ensure deletion of all existing copies of your data or information.  Researchers will be encouraged to use the most current version of the Self-contributed Genomic Data Cohort public database, but your data may be combined in ways that will make it impossible to delete them from all existing datasets. Is my health information protected after it has been given to others? There is a risk that your information will be given to others without your permission.  COMPENSATION FOR INJURY There is no physical participation required for this study. If you are physically injured as a result or your participation in this study, please seek medical care immediately and contact the Principal Investigator.  This study does not provide any health or medical care to participants.  VOLUNTARY PARTICIPATION AND WITHDRAWAL Your participation in this study is voluntary.

this consent form to think about or discuss with family or friends before making your decision. summary you are being asked to be in a research study. the purpose of this consent form is to help you decide if you want to be in the research study. please read this form carefully. to be in a research study you must give your informed consent. informed consent includes: completing the online tutorial reading this consent form, asking questions to the investigator or staff about anything that is not clear, and printing out an unsigned copy of this consent form. this gives you time to think about it and to talk to family or friends before you make your decision. you should not join this research study until all of your questions are answered. things to know before deciding to take part in a research study: the main goal of a research study is to learn things to help patients in the future. the main goal of regular medical care is to help each patient. the decision to join or not join the research study will not cause you to lose any medical benefits. if you decide not to take part in this study, your doctor will continue to treat you. after going through the online materials and reading the consent form you should understand the goals of the research study and the risks of taking part in the study. any data you contribute such as personal genomic or health data or your medical records may become part of the research record. if that happens, your data and medical records will be looked at and/or copied by the sponsor of this study and government agencies or other groups associated with the study. purpose of the study traditionally, most scientific research involves selected individuals who volunteer time, contribute samples and data in the name of improving our collective understanding and small groups of researchers who analyze that data and publish their findings in scientific literature. once the project is over, it s over, and re-using the data is hard to do. the purpose of this study is to create a far larger group of participants, to make it far easier to re-use the data again and again, and to allow any volunteer to play an active role in the scientific research process. the study is possible through technical and legal tools that permit participants to broadly share and distribute their data for research purposes, and tools that make it easy for researchers to use your data to improve our common understanding of human genomics and health. the experimental components of this study are: o the completion of mixed- media information modules and an online informed consent process. o the provision of personal, genomic and health-related information o the broad availability of the collected datasets to any interested researcher who have explicitly agreed to the study s terms and conditions.. one of the primary aims of the cgr is to build large, open datasets and tools that make it easy for scientists to work together and innovate by utilizing health data. while we believe that promoting public research is crucial to the rapid advancement of scientific and medical knowledge, we also recognize that it carries a unique set of risks and considerations for participants. this document is designed to help you understand those risks and to make an informed choice about whether to participate in creating a self-contributed genomic data cohort/ plc-cgr procedures sage bionetworks is conducting a study that will collect genomic, phenotypic, observational, health-related and other forms of information from volunteer individuals. the information will be owned by the individuals (i.e., already in their possession) and uploaded by electronic means, including websites and software applications. the information will be provided by the individuals to the study, and not generated by the study investigators. to respect participant s privacy, unless otherwise requested, information that can directly identify the participant will be removed from the data prior to making it available to researchers. information that can directly identify participants are: 1. names; 2. all geographical subdivisions smaller than a state, including street address, city, county, precinct, zip code, and their equivalent geocodes, except for the initial three digits of a zip code, if according to the current publicly available data from the bureau of the census: (1) the geographic unit formed by combining all zip codes with the same three initial digits contains more than 20,000 people; and (2) the initial three digits of a zip code for all such geographic units containing 20,000 or fewer people is changed to 000. 3. all elements of dates (except year) for dates directly related to an individual, including birth date, admission date, discharge date, date of death; and all ages over 89 and all elements of dates (including year) indicative of such age, except that such ages and elements may be aggregated into a single category of age 90 or older; 4. phone numbers; 5. fax numbers; 6. electronic mail addresses; 7. social security numbers; 8. medical record numbers; 9. health plan beneficiary numbers; 10. account numbers; 11. certificate/license numbers; 12. vehicle identifiers and serial numbers, including license plate numbers; 13. device identifiers and serial numbers; 14. web universal resource locators (urls); 15. internet protocol (ip) address numbers; 16. biometric identifiers, including finger and voice prints; 17. full face photographic images and any comparable images; and 18. any other unique identifying number, characteristic, or code (note this does not mean the unique code assigned by the investigator to code the data) o however, even with removal of these identifying information points, it is sometimes possible to re-identify individuals uniquely given enough information about the individual. this risk should be contemplated prior to enrolling. individuals will be assigned a global unique identifier (guid) that will be published alongside their data. the guid will allow for new data that participants upload to be connected to their old data, or for data that is uploaded from multiple venues to be connected. the guid will also serve as a mechanism for researchers to send messages to participants without having to reveal the identities of participants. data collected will be made available, for research purposes, to a broad variety of users who have agreed to be bound by a contract and to specific terms and conditions that include use of the data in an ethical manner, to do no harm, not re-identify or re-contact individuals, and to make their research results openly available to the general public. risks and discomforts the main risk of donating your personal, genetic and health-related information is the loss of confidentiality. the following is a non-comprehensive list of scenarios that could pose risks for you and/or your family: data that you provide (such as trait data or dna sequence or other genetic data) may be used to identify you. this may, among other things, result in contact from the press and other members of the public motivated by positive or negative feelings about one or more studies. this could mean a significant loss of privacy and personal time. if you enroll in the creation of a self-contributed genomic data cohort, it is possible that data not intended to be published (e.g., your name, date of birth, or contact information) will be publicly disclosed due to unintended data breaches, including hacking or other activities outside of the procedures authorized by the study, or may be used for unauthorized purposes despite the restrictions that those using data are required to agree to. should this occur you would be subject to the various risks and discomforts described in this section and throughout this consent form, and possibly to other risks as well, even though you did not intend for such data to be published or misused. the public disclosure of your genetic and trait data could cause you to learn either directly, from a family member or from another individual certain unexpected genealogical features about you and/or your family. in particular, you might learn things about your genetic features that might cast doubt on paternity in your family. the public disclosure of your genetic and trait data could allow someone sufficiently skilled in data analysis to reveal to you or a member of your family the possibility of a disease or other trait or propensity for a disease or other trait. the public disclosure of your genetic and trait data could allow someone sufficiently skilled in data analysis to claim statistical evidence, including with respect to your genetic predisposition to certain diseases or other traits, that could affect the ability of you and/or your family to obtain or maintain employment, insurance or financial services (for example, your genotype indicates you have a statistically higher probability of prostate cancer, and thus life insurance premiums increase); whether or not it is lawful to do so, you could be subject to actual or attempted employment, insurance, financial, or other forms of discrimination or negative treatment due to the public disclosure of your genetic and trait information through this study or by a third party. although united states law bars certain forms of genetic discrimination (the genetic information nondiscrimination act, also known as gina), this law does not apply to the use of genetic

PURPOSE AND BACKGROUND  The purpose of this study is to create a storage bank to be used in future research to learn more about preventing, diagnosis and treating disease. You are being asked to donate your human biological material (tissue, blood and cells from the inside of your cheek) because you have a gastrointestinal (GI) disease, are a family member of someone with GI disease or are a healthy volunteer without GI disease. The investigator in charge of this study is Don C. Rockey, M.D. This study is being done at MUSC and will involve approximately 5,000 volunteers.    B. PROCEDURES  If you decide to take part, the following will happen:  Screening: After enrollment into the study, research personnel will collect and review information from your medical record. The research personnel may also ask you  questions about your medical history.    Information Collection: An investigator will conduct a brief question and answer session to obtain basic information about you and your background. This data includes demographic information (e.g., name, address, phone, date of birth, sex, race and ethnic origin), medical history and records (e.g., medications, history of GI disease) and family history of GI, cancer, or autoimmune diseases.    Medical Record: If you are a GI patient, we will review your medical records for information about your history and treatment that will make your donated samples more useful to the research community. This data includes demographic information (e.g., name, address, phone, date of birth, sex, race and ethnic origin), medical history and records (e.g., medications, history of GI disease) and family history of GI, cancer, or autoimmune diseases. Investigators may use your health information for future research on various diseases. However, your personally identifiable information will never be released to researchers outside the Medical University of South Carolina. All of your information will be stored on a password protected database on a password protected network drive. All samples will be in a secure biological material bank.    Study Procedures - as a participant, you will undergo the following procedures: Collection of your material:    Blood sample: If you are a GI patient and scheduled to have blood drawn as part of your routine medical care, then we will obtain an additional blood draw of up to 35ml (Approximately 7 teaspoons). If you do not have a blood draw as part of your routine medical care, we will setup a separate appointment.      IRB Number: Pro00027522  1  Date Approved 8/18/2015  Expiration Date: 8/17/2016      If you are a family member or healthy volunteer, up to 25ml (5 teaspoons) of blood will be drawn from you through a needle in your arm.    Buccal swab for tissue cells: We also use a small brush to rub the inside of your cheek in order to obtain tissue cells for genetic analysis.    Tissue sample: If you are a GI patient and have a standard of care medical procedure that removes tissue, we will collect some of the tissue left over after tissue needed to make clinical decisions has been obtained.    For all samples collected:  • Donated samples will be assigned a unique code and transported to the MUSC  Gastrointestinal Disease Biorepository. Only research personnel will have access to the samples within the MUSC Gastrointestinal Disease Biorepository and these  samples will be stored with the unique code that links the samples to you. Research staff will collect medical information at the time of initial biospecimen collection and also review your chart at regular intervals in order to obtain follow-up information.    • Samples and associated data collected under this protocol will be de-identified and released to other researchers, per requests accompanied by the necessary IRB  approvals and documentation for their research study.    • Donated Samples will be stored indefinitely and information may continue to be collected as long as you have not withdrawn consent. If you withdraw consent, it must be requested in writing. The unused samples will be destroyed and no  additional data will be collected or made available for future research. However, samples and data already being used for research prior to the date of the request will continue to be used for the IRB approved research study.    • MUSC SCTR Biorepository: In addition to the MUSC GI Disease Biorepository, a small left over portion of DNA samples will be donated to the MUSC SCTR  Biorepository and made available for other physicians for their research purposes with IRB approval. The samples that are donated to the MUSC SCTR Biorepository  will also use a unique code on the labels that will allow us to link your sample back to you.    To withdraw your permission, please submit your request in writing to:    Don C. Rockey, M.D.  96 Jonathan Lucas Street  CSB 803  Charleston, SC 29425      IRB Number: Pro00027522  2  Date Approved 8/18/2015  Expiration Date: 8/17/2016      Future participation in Research:    We may wish to see if you would like to participate in other research studies in the future. Please initial your choice below if you are willing to be recontacted. If you agree to be recontacted; this does not obligate you to participate in any future research opportunities.    Yes _______(initial)    No_______(initial)    Initial next to the sample you agree to donate:    yes______ no_____ donate blood sample    yes______ no_____ donate buccal swab for tissue cells    yes______ no_____ donate tissue sample (GI patients only)    C. DURATION    Samples are collected as a one-time visit when you are at the hospital. Your samples and clinical data will be stored indefinitely and information may be continue to be collected as long as you have not withdrawn your MUSC Gastrointestinal Disease Biorepository consent. Medical records will be reviewed once a year for five years.    D. BIOSPECIMEN STORAGE  This specimen storage bank works in such a way that is sensitive to your confidential information. Your name and any other information that directly identifies you will be removed from any specimen labels and containers. The information about your identity will be replaced with a coded number that will allow us to trace your sample back to you.  All other medical information, such as your name, diseases, age, gender, and ethnic group will be stored separately from your materials in a password protected secure database.    When you give permission for this material to be stored and used for research, you are also giving permission for researchers to review your medical record for information about your health and to study this material with this information. Your material will not be used for research unless the research study is reviewed and approved by the Medical University of South Carolina Institutional Review Board for Human Research.    This material might be given to researchers outside of the Medical University of South Carolina for research projects. If this is done, your name will not be released with the material; a code will be attached so other researchers will not know the material belongs to you.      IRB Number: Pro00027522  3  Date Approved 8/18/2015  Expiration Date: 8/17/2016      E. RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS  There are risks to taking part in this research study. One risk is the loss of confidentiality; however we have taken steps to minimize this risk by using unique codes instead of your name or other patient identifiers on biospecimen labels.    Risks and side effects related to the collection of your material include:    • The risks of blood drawing include temporary discomfort from the needle stick, bruising, infection or clot in the vein. Fainting could occur.    • The risks of obtaining a buccal swab may include slight pressure against the cheek when obtaining the sample.    Research to identify genes that cause or contribute to a disease or trait is an increasingly important way to try to understand the role of genes in human disease. You have been given this consent form because the Medical University of South Carolina investigators want to include your tissue, cell or blood sample in a research project, or because they want to save such biological samples for future research. There are several things you should know before allowing your tissues, cells or blood to be studied or to be stored.    • Your tissue, cell or blood sample will be stored under your name or some other type of identifier which could be linked to you. Sometimes these samples are shared for research purposes with other investigators at other research sites. If this is done, the other investigators would not know your name.    • In addition to your name, other information about you might be connected to your blood, cells or tissue sample. For instance, information about race, ethnicity, sex, your medical history, and so forth might be available to investigators studying your blood, cells or tissue samples. Such information is important for scientific reasons and sometimes for public health. It is possible that genetic information might come to be associated with your racial or ethnic group.    • Genetic information about you will often apply (in one degree or another) to family members. It is not generally the University’s policy to provide genetic information about you to your family members. However, certain studies, called ""pedigree studies"", share such information among family members. For this and related research you will be asked if you are willing to share your genetic information with your family members.    • You have the right to refuse to allow your blood, cells or tissue samples to be studied or saved for future research studies. You may withdraw from this study at any time and remove any samples that contain identifiers from research use after the date of your withdrawal. This means that while the University might retain the identified samples-the law often requires this-they would not be used for research.      IRB Number: Pro00027522  4  Date Approved 8/18/2015  Expiration Date: 8/17/2016      • South Carolina law mandates that your genetic information obtained from any tests or from this research, be kept confidential. Our state law prohibits any insurer using this information in a discriminatory manner against you or any member of your family in issuing or renewing insurance coverage for you or your family. Our state law further prohibits our sharing your genetic information with anyone except in a few narrow circumstances, one of these being a research project of this type, approved by the Institutional Review Board and then we must take all steps to protect your identity. You will still be responsible for paying for health care, however. The Medical University of South Carolina will not be responsible for such costs, even if care is needed for a condition revealed during research or clinical testing.    • Genetic research raises difficult questions about informing you and other subjects of any results, or of future results. Some people feel anxious about the possibility of having a defective gene that would place them or their children at risk. Some people want to know what is found out about them; others do not. The risks of knowing include anxiety and other psychological distress. The risks of not knowing what is found include not being aware if there is treatment for the problem being studied. But these risks can change depending on whether there is a treatment or cure for a particular disease, and on how clear the results are. If there is a medical reason to seek specific information from you, your doctor will tell you this. A process called ""genetic counseling"" is often appropriate in such cases; you should ask your doctor or nurse about this if you have any questions.    Investigators in this study may try to recontact you in the future to find out about your health.  If you are recontacted and want to know what the investigators have learned about your samples, you should understand that the following are the kinds of things the Investigators or your health team might tell you:    A. Information is too sketchy to give you particular details, but you will receive a newsletter informing you about the results of the project.  B. You carry a gene for a particular disease that can be treated.  C. You can carry a gene for a particular disease for which there is no current treatment. This news might cause severe anxiety or other psychological distress, depending on the severity of the disease.  D. You carry a gene for a disease and might consider informing relatives that they, too, might carry the gene. It can be very difficult to decide whether to share such information with relatives. Genetic counselors can help sort out the various  options in such a case.    Also, for any future research, we may contact you with a new consent form giving you additional information.    If you are concerned about a potential genetic disorder, you and your doctor might choose to test specifically for it. This would require additional blood or tissue samples and would not be part of this research project. You should discuss this option with your doctor or genetic counselor.      IRB Number: Pro00027522  5  Date Approved 8/18/2015  Expiration Date: 8/17/2016      The presence of a genetic marker does not necessarily mean that an individual will develop a disease. Informing people of all such markers independently of medical need can cause unnecessary anxiety. On the other hand, the absence of a marker does not mean that someone will not get the disease. Genetic diseases appear as a result of a complex mixture of hereditary, environmental, behavioral and other factors.    These are the best-known risks and challenges of genetic research. There might be other risks we do not know about yet. It is important that you talk to your doctor, nurse or genetic counselor if you have questions or concerns about the research study.    For more information about risks and side effects, ask one of the researchers or study staff.    F. BENEFITS  There will be no direct benefit to you from participating in this study. We hope the information learned from this study will benefit other people with similar conditions in the future.    G. COSTS  There will be no cost to you for donating your samples. Expenses for routine health care for any medical problems will remain to be your responsibility (or the responsibility of your insurance provider or government program).    H. PAYMENT TO PARTICIPANTS  You will not be paid for participating in this study.    I. ALTERNATIVES    The alternative is to not participate. Participating in this project is voluntary.    J.

biorespository a. purpose and background the purpose of this study is to create a storage bank to be used in future research to learn more about preventing, diagnosis and treating disease. you are being asked to donate your human biological material (tissue, blood and cells from the inside of your cheek) because you have a gastrointestinal (gi) disease, are a family member of someone with gi disease or are a healthy volunteer without gi disease. the investigator in charge of this study is don c. rockey, m.d. this study is being done at musc and will involve approximately 5,000 volunteers. b. procedures if you decide to take part, the following will happen: screening: after enrollment into the study, research personnel will collect and review information from your medical record. the research personnel may also ask you questions about your medical history. information collection: an investigator will conduct a brief question and answer session to obtain basic information about you and your background. this data includes demographic information (e.g., name, address, phone, date of birth, sex, race and ethnic origin), medical history and records (e.g., medications, history of gi disease) and family history of gi, cancer, or autoimmune diseases. medical record: if you are a gi patient, we will review your medical records for information about your history and treatment that will make your donated samples more useful to the research community. this data includes demographic information (e.g., name, address, phone, date of birth, sex, race and ethnic origin), medical history and records (e.g., medications, history of gi disease) and family history of gi, cancer, or autoimmune diseases. investigators may use your health information for future research on various diseases. however, your personally identifiable information will never be released to researchers outside the medical university of south carolina. all of your information will be stored on a password protected database on a password protected network drive. all samples will be in a secure biological material bank. study procedures - as a participant, you will undergo the following procedures: collection of your material: blood sample: if you are a gi patient and scheduled to have blood drawn as part of your routine medical care, then we will obtain an additional blood draw of up to 35ml (approximately 7 teaspoons). if you do not have a blood draw as part of your routine medical care, we will setup a separate appointment. irb number: pro00027522 1 date approved 8/18/2015 expiration date: 8/17/2016 if you are a family member or healthy volunteer, up to 25ml (5 teaspoons) of blood will be drawn from you through a needle in your arm. buccal swab for tissue cells: we also use a small brush to rub the inside of your cheek in order to obtain tissue cells for genetic analysis. tissue sample: if you are a gi patient and have a standard of care medical procedure that removes tissue, we will collect some of the tissue left over after tissue needed to make clinical decisions has been obtained. for all samples collected: donated samples will be assigned a unique code and transported to the musc gastrointestinal disease biorepository. only research personnel will have access to the samples within the musc gastrointestinal disease biorepository and these samples will be stored with the unique code that links the samples to you. research staff will collect medical information at the time of initial biospecimen collection and also review your chart at regular intervals in order to obtain follow-up information. samples and associated data collected under this protocol will be de-identified and released to other researchers, per requests accompanied by the necessary irb approvals and documentation for their research study. donated samples will be stored indefinitely and information may continue to be collected as long as you have not withdrawn consent. if you withdraw consent, it must be requested in writing. the unused samples will be destroyed and no additional data will be collected or made available for future research. however, samples and data already being used for research prior to the date of the request will continue to be used for the irb approved research study. musc sctr biorepository: in addition to the musc gi disease biorepository, a small left over portion of dna samples will be donated to the musc sctr biorepository and made available for other physicians for their research purposes with irb approval. the samples that are donated to the musc sctr biorepository will also use a unique code on the labels that will allow us to link your sample back to you. to withdraw your permission, please submit your request in writing to: don c. rockey, m.d. 96 jonathan lucas street csb 803 charleston, sc 29425 irb number: pro00027522 2 date approved 8/18/2015 expiration date: 8/17/2016 future participation in research: we may wish to see if you would like to participate in other research studies in the future. please initial your choice below if you are willing to be recontacted. if you agree to be recontacted; this does not obligate you to participate in any future research opportunities. yes (initial) no(initial) initial next to the sample you agree to donate: yes no donate blood sample yes no donate buccal swab for tissue cells yes no donate tissue sample (gi patients only) c. duration samples are collected as a one-time visit when you are at the hospital. your samples and clinical data will be stored indefinitely and information may be continue to be collected as long as you have not withdrawn your musc gastrointestinal disease biorepository consent. medical records will be reviewed once a year for five years. d. biospecimen storage this specimen storage bank works in such a way that is sensitive to your confidential information. your name and any other information that directly identifies you will be removed from any specimen labels and containers. the information about your identity will be replaced with a coded number that will allow us to trace your sample back to you. all other medical information, such as your name, diseases, age, gender, and ethnic group will be stored separately from your materials in a password protected secure database. when you give permission for this material to be stored and used for research, you are also giving permission for researchers to review your medical record for information about your health and to study this material with this information. your material will not be used for research unless the research study is reviewed and approved by the medical university of south carolina institutional review board for human research. this material might be given to researchers outside of the medical university of south carolina for research projects. if this is done, your name will not be released with the material; a code will be attached so other researchers will not know the material belongs to you. irb number: pro00027522 3 date approved 8/18/2015 expiration date: 8/17/2016 e. risks and discomforts there are risks to taking part in this research study. one risk is the loss of confidentiality; however we have taken steps to minimize this risk by using unique codes instead of your name or other patient identifiers on biospecimen labels. risks and side effects related to the collection of your material include: the risks of blood drawing include temporary discomfort from the needle stick, bruising, infection or clot in the vein. fainting could occur. the risks of obtaining a buccal swab may include slight pressure against the cheek when obtaining the sample. research to identify genes that cause or contribute to a disease or trait is an increasingly important way to try to understand the role of genes in human disease. you have been given this consent form because the medical university of south carolina investigators want to include your tissue, cell or blood sample in a research project, or because they want to save such biological samples for future research. there are several things you should know before allowing your tissues, cells or blood to be studied or to be stored. your tissue, cell or blood sample will be stored under your name or some other type of identifier which could be linked to you. sometimes these samples are shared for research purposes with other investigators at other research sites. if this is done, the other investigators would not know your name. in addition to your name, other information about you might be connected to your blood, cells or tissue sample. for instance, information about race, ethnicity, sex, your medical history, and so forth might be available to investigators studying your blood, cells or tissue samples. such information is important for scientific reasons and sometimes for public health. it is possible that genetic information might come to be associated with your racial or ethnic group. genetic information about you will often apply (in one degree or another) to family members. it is not generally the university s policy to provide genetic information about you to your family members. however, certain studies, called ""pedigree studies"", share such information among family members. for this and related research you will be asked if you are willing to share your genetic information with your family members. you have the right to refuse to allow your blood, cells or tissue samples to be studied or saved for future research studies. you may withdraw from this study at any time and remove any samples that contain identifiers from research use after the date of your withdrawal. this means that while the university might retain the identified samples-the law often requires this-they would not be used for research. irb number: pro00027522 4 date approved 8/18/2015 expiration date: 8/17/2016 south carolina law mandates that your genetic information obtained from any tests or from this research, be kept confidential. our state law prohibits any insurer using this information in a discriminatory manner against you or any member of your family in issuing or renewing insurance coverage for you or your family. our state law further prohibits our sharing your genetic information with anyone except in a few narrow circumstances, one of these being a research project of this type, approved by the institutional review board and then we must take all steps to protect your identity. you will still be responsible for paying for health care, however. the medical university of south carolina will not be responsible for such costs, even if care is needed for a condition revealed during research or clinical testing. genetic research raises difficult questions about informing you and other subjects of any results, or of future results. some people feel anxious about the possibility of having a defective gene that would place them or their children at risk. some people want to know what is found out about them; others do not. the risks of knowing include anxiety and other psychological distress. the risks of not knowing what is found include not being aware if there is treatment for the problem being studied. but these risks can change depending on whether there is a treatment or cure for a particular disease, and on how clear the results are. if there is a medical reason to seek specific information from you, your doctor will tell you this. a process called ""genetic counseling"" is often appropriate in such cases; you should ask your doctor or nurse about this if you have any questions. investigators in this study may try to recontact you in the future to find out about your health. if you are recontacted and want to know what the investigators have learned about your samples, you should understand that the following are the kinds of things the investigators or your health team might tell you: a. information is too sketchy to give you particular details, but you will receive a newsletter informing you about the results of the project. b. you carry a gene for a particular disease that can be treated. c. you can carry a gene for a particular disease for which there is no current treatment. this news might cause severe anxiety or other psychological distress, depending on the severity of the disease. d. you carry a gene for a disease and might consider informing relatives that they, too, might carry the gene. it can be very difficult to decide whether to share such information with relatives. genetic counselors can help sort out the various options in such a case. also, for any future research, we may contact you with a new consent form giving you additional information. if you are concerned about a potential genetic disorder, you and your doctor might choose to test specifically for it. this would require additional blood or tissue samples and would not be part of this research project. you should discuss this option with your doctor or genetic counselor. irb number: pro00027522 5 date approved 8/18/2015 expiration date: 8/17/2016 the presence of a genetic marker does not necessarily mean that an individual will develop a disease. informing people of all such markers independently of medical need can cause unnecessary anxiety. on the other hand, the absence of a marker does not mean that someone will not get the disease. genetic diseases appear as a result of a complex mixture of hereditary, environmental, behavioral and other factors. these are the best-known risks and challenges of genetic research. there might be other risks we do not know about yet. it is important that you talk to your doctor, nurse or genetic counselor if you have questions or concerns about the research study. for more information about risks and side effects, ask one of the researchers or study staff. f. benefits there will be no direct benefit to you from participating in this study. we hope the information learned from this study will benefit other people with similar conditions in the future. g. costs there will be no cost to you for donating your samples. expenses for routine health care for any medical problems will remain to be your responsibility (or the responsibility of your insurance provider or government program). h. payment to participants you will not be paid for participating in this study. i. alternatives the alternative is to not participate. participating in this project is voluntary. j. privacy statements privacy of protected health information: the researchers and staff of the medical university of south carolina who are involved in this research study will

Northwestern University Center for Genetic Medicine 676 N. St. Clair, Suite 1260 Chicago, IL 60611 CONSENT FORM AND AUTHORIZATION FOR RESEARCH Project Title: NUgene: Gene-Disease Association and Treatment Outcomes                        Principal Investigator: Rex L. Chisholm Funded by: Northwestern University Center for Genetic Medicine You are being asked to take part in a research project.  This document has important information  about the reason for this project, what you will do if you choose to be in this project, and the way  we (i.e. Northwestern University) would like to use information about you and your health. What is the reason for doing this project? Northwestern University has created a genetic bank.  A genetic bank is a collection of blood-based  samples, such as DNA and RNA, and health information from many people.  The genetic samples  and health information will be shared with researchers for future research about the role genes  play in human diseases.  You are being asked to contribute to this genetic bank because you are a patient at Northwestern  Medicine or one of its affiliates.  What you will do if you choose to be in this project?  If you agree to take part in this project, you will be asked to: 1. Give one tablespoon (10ml) of blood 2. Fill out a brief questionnaire 3. Allow us ongoing access to and review of your electronic medical records for any visit to  Northwestern Medicine or its affiliates for as long as you remain a participant in this project What are some of the risks and discomforts that may happen to people who are in this  project?   Contributing to this genetic bank may involve the following risks: 1. Potential risks of drawing blood include a bruise at the point where blood is taken,  redness and swelling of the vein, and infection.  Care will be taken to avoid these  complications. 2. Some of the questions we ask may be upsetting or you may feel uncomfortable  answering them.  You are always free to skip any questions you do not want to answer. 3. Disease testing and genetic research can involve a number of risks.  Genetic research  results may have the possibility to lead to health or life insurance discrimination as well as  job or social discrimination. 4. As with all medical information, there is also a risk in allowing access to your hospital  medical records Page 1 of 6 IRB #: STU00010003 Approved by NU IRB for use on or after 11/23/2015 through 11/22/2016. What steps have been taken to minimize these risks? This project has taken precautions to decrease these risks in the following ways: 1. The genetic information, research results, and the medical information used in  these studies are labeled with a unique number and NOT with any personal  identification, so there is little risk that the results can be linked to you. 2. No information about your participation in the NUgene Project will be placed in  your medical records. 3. The genetic information, questionnaire information, and health information are  kept in a secure database or in our collaborators’ secure database, separate from  any identifying information (such as your name, date of birth, and social security  number).   4. The Principal Investigator of the NUgene Project has obtained a Certificate of  Confidentiality from the federal government.  This document protects your study  records from being subpoenaed (released to the courts at their request), and we will  only release your records for a subpoena if you ask us to in writing. What are some of the benefits that are likely to come from me being a part of this project? Taking part in this project will not benefit you directly.  Joining this genetic bank may help  researchers to better understand health problems and/or the role genes play in health, and  possibly in the development of new treatments or screening tests as we improve our understanding  of what causes many health problems. Are there any financial costs to being a part of this project? You will not be charged for any project-related procedures. You will not be paid for your participation in this project. The research done with your sample may lead to the development of new products in the future.   In some instances, these products may have commercial value and may be developed and owned  by the researchers, Northwestern University, and/or others, including companies.  No payment will  be given to you now or in the future for the use of your sample or data. If I have questions or concerns about this research project, whom can I call? You can call us with your questions or concerns. Rex Chisholm, PhD, is the person in charge of  this research study. You can call him or a member of the NUgene Project staff at telephone  number (312) 695-0700, Monday through Friday, 8:30 am - 4:30 pm. What are my rights as a research subject? If you choose to be in this project, you have the right to be treated with respect, including respect  for your decision whether or not you wish to continue or stop being a part of the project.  You are  free to choose to stop being a part of the project at any time.   Choosing not to be in this project or to stop being in this project will not result in any penalty to you  or loss of benefit to which you are entitled.  Specifically, your choice not to be in this study will not  negatively affect your right to any present or future medical treatment, your class standing (for  students enrolled in a class), or present or future employment to which you are otherwise entitled.  Page 2 of 6 IRB #: STU00010003 Approved by NU IRB for use on or after 11/23/2015 through 11/22/2016. If you want to speak with someone who is not directly involved in this project, or have questions  about your rights as a research subject, please contact the Office for the Protection of Research  Subjects. You can call them at (312) 503-9338. What about my confidentiality and privacy rights?  We are committed to respecting your privacy and keeping your personal information confidential. To create this genetic bank and for you to be in this project, we will need to access your electronic  medical records to collect health and treatment information.  This information includes your name  and date of birth, and we request that you provide us with your social security number or medical  record number.  You have the right to decide if we can use and share the health information you  provide us and the information from your electronic medical records for this project.  Your health information we may collect or share for this project includes all information contained in  your electronic medical record such as:  Results of physical examinations  Medical history   Lab tests, or certain health information indicating or relating to a particular condition as well  diaries and questionnaires  HIV results; including diagnoses, treatment, response and laboratory testing  Mental health information; including diagnoses, treatment, response and laboratory testing  If you sign this document, you are allowing the following groups of people to give information about  you (described above) to the researchers of this project:  All current and previous health care  providers affiliated with Northwestern Medicine and Ann & Robert L. Lurie Children’s Hospital of  Chicago. When your sample is collected, the sample and your health information will be identified by  a unique number and not by your name or any identifying information (also called de- identified).  In all cases where information relating to your sample and health information is  shared with any of the people or groups listed below, you will be identified by a unique  number and not by name, social security number, address, telephone number, or any direct  identifier unless required by law or you specifically give permission.  To do more powerful research, it is helpful for researchers to share information they may get from  studying human samples. They do this by putting it into one or more scientific databases, where it  is stored along with information from other studies. Once we have your health information, we may  share the de-identified information with:  Authorized members of the Northwestern University workforce, who may need to see your  information, such as administrative staff members from the Office of Research, and  members of the Institutional Review Board (a committee which is responsible for the ethical  oversight of this project)   Other University research centers and University contractors who are also working on the  project  Study monitors and auditors who make sure that the project is being done properly  Page 3 of 6 IRB #: STU00010003 Approved by NU IRB for use on or after 11/23/2015 through 11/22/2016.  Other researchers whose studies have been approved to access the information described  above  Commercial research and drug companies whose studies have been approved to access  the information described above  Government agencies and public health authorities, such as the Food and Drug  Administration (FDA), the Department of Health and Human Services (DHSS), and the  National Institutes of Health (NIH).  Other academic research center(s)  Access to these scientific databases is restricted and can only be used by approved researchers.   Although your information is de-identified, because genetic information is unique to you, there is a  small chance that someone could trace it back to you. The risk of this happening is very small.  Researchers will always have a duty to protect your privacy and to keep your information  confidential.  The results from this project may also be used for teaching, research, publications, or  presentations at scientific meetings.  Please note that:  You do not have to sign this consent form.  If you do not, it will not affect your treatment by  health care providers, or the payment or enrollment in any health plans, or affect your  eligibility for benefits. However, you will not be allowed to take part in this research study.   You may change your mind and “take back” (revoke) this consent at any time. Even if you  revoke this consent, the Principal Investigator may still use or share health information that  was obtained about you before you revoked your consent as needed for the purpose of this  study. To revoke your consent for the use of your health information, you must do so in  writing to: Rex Chisholm, 676 N. St. Clair Street, Suite 1260, Chicago, IL 60611.  Unless you revoke your consent, it will not expire.  If you revoke your consent to use any blood or tissue taken for the study, the Principal  Investigator will make sure your genetic sample is destroyed and no further medical  information will be collected from your electronic medical records.

If you are interested in enrolling in the Biobank, please go to the  link provided on the Contact Us page to email Biobank study staff  and they will send you the appropriate materials.      Name and Clinic Number         IRB # 08-007049 00   Consent form approved July 25, 2013;   This consent valid through July 24, 2014;      1. General Information About This Research  Study      Study Title: Mayo Clinic Biobank      Name of Principal Investigator: Dr. J. R. Cerhan and Colleagues      Researchers at Mayo Clinic are developing a new research resource called a biobank.  Participants in the Biobank provide samples of blood, complete a health questionnaire,  and allow access to medical records now and in the future. The Biobank serves as a  library for researchers; instead of having to look for volunteers for each new project,  researchers can use samples from the Biobank as well as share information already  collected.      You are being asked to give samples and information to the Mayo Clinic Biobank, which  will be used by many different researchers for many different studies. Most of the  researchers who use the samples and information in the Biobank will be studying DNA.  DNA is found in every cell in your body, and contains all of your genetic information.  Researchers know that genetic information determines things like hair and eye color, and  are trying to figure out how it affects what diseases people get.      Do you have to participate?      No. Participation is voluntary. Your decision will not affect your health care at Mayo  Clinic in any way.      Take your time before deciding whether to enroll. Feel free to talk it over with your  family, friends, and healthcare provider. If you do not understand any part of this consent  form, please ask questions.      If you choose to give samples and information to the Biobank, sign this form after you  have read it. Your signature means you have been told about the Biobank and understand  that participation involves some risks.      You may request that we remove your sample from the Biobank at any time.          Why have you been asked to participate?      You were asked because you were a patient at Mayo Clinic or one of its affiliated Health  Systems. Anyone who is at least 18 years old, has a Mayo patient identifier number and is  a resident of the United States can participate.      Why does Mayo Clinic want a biobank?      A biobank will make it much easier to conduct research studies, because researchers will  have access to blood samples, along with patient data from thousands of people all in one  place. It is Mayo Clinics hope that future research using information from the Biobank  will lead to improved health care.      Will the Biobank be used for human cloning?      Many people are worried that samples in the Biobank could be used for embryonic stem  cell research or human cloning. It is not possible to do embryonic stem cell research or  human cloning using samples from the Biobank.      How many people are donating to the Biobank?      The plan is to have 50,000 people take part in the Biobank. All donors will be volunteers.      2. What will happen when I enroll in the  Biobank?      Initially, you will be asked to:      . Provide a sample of blood (about 4 tablespoons): Your blood contains DNA,  which has all of your genetic information. Researchers are especially interested in  studying DNA, although many types of studies will be done using the samples in  the Biobank.       . Allow us to obtain information from your medical record: Once you sign this  form, researchers can review your medical records at Mayo Clinic now and in the  future to gather medical information needed for research. Looking at your  records allows researchers to learn information that might be helpful during  specific studies. You will not be informed if researchers look at your medical  records. Details about how we will keep your information private are in section 8.       . Complete a questionnaire about yourself: This questionnaire will take about 30  minutes to complete and will ask you about your background, environment and  family history.     . Return the completed materials in person or via the enclosed postage paid  envelope. . If you have any questions please call us at 866-613-2386 (toll free).  You may also visit our website, which can be found at:  http://mayoresearch.mayo.edu/mayo/research/biobank/index.cfm)    In the future, we may      . Occasionally ask you to fill out additional questionnaires: We may send  additional questionnaires to your home. You can decide if you wish to complete  and return them. Biobank staff will not contact you more than twice every year  (and generally much less), and such contact does not mean that anything has been  learned about your health.       . Occasionally ask you to provide an additional blood sample: We may ask for  additional samples in order to study changes in your blood over time, or because  we used up the first sample you provided. If we ask you for another sample, you  may always say no.       3. How long will my sample and  information be kept in the Biobank?      The Biobank is a resource meant to serve the Mayo Clinic community for years, and  there are no plans for it to end. By participating, you are agreeing to be a part of ongoing  health research conducted at Mayo Clinic. Your donation will enable researchers to  examine the roots of disease for many years to come.      In this consent form we talk about the sample and information you are giving to the  Biobank. Your personal medical information is made up of the answers you give to the  health questionnaire that you fill out, as well as information from your medical record.      You have the right to leave the project any time. There are three ways you can do this:      1. you can decide that you no longer want researchers to contact you, but that they  can keep examining your samples and personal medical information, or  2. you can ask researchers to destroy what is left of your blood sample, but allow  them to keep using the information and samples you already provided, or  3. you can have your remaining samples destroyed, and tell researchers to stop using  your personal medical information.        When leaving the project, please note:      1. you cannot withdraw your samples and information from studies that have already  begun,  2. Biobank staff cannot get back samples or medical information that have been  shared with other research institutions, and  3. Biobank staff will stop using your medical information if you ask us to, but we  will not be able to remove existing information from our databases.       If you want to leave the project, please:    call us at 866-613-2386 (toll free),   e-mail us at biobank@mayo.edu, or   write to the following address and tell us what you want us to do with your  samples and information:       Mayo Clinic Biobank   ATTN: Notice of Revocation of Authorization   Harwick 6   200 1st Street SW   Rochester, MN 55905      If you wish to stay in the Biobank, but move, please contact us with your new address so  we can continue to involve you in the Biobank.      4. Will other samples be included in the  Biobank?      Mayo Clinic routinely stores tissue from surgical procedures. If you give us permission,  researchers may use your tissue from either past or future procedures at Mayo Clinic.      You will not have extra surgeries or procedures because you take part in the Biobank.  The amount of tissue taken by doctors for your regular medical care will not be affected  by your participation.      If you do not want Biobank studies to use your extra tissue samples for research, please  check the box below:       I do not want the Biobank to use my extra tissue for research      If you do not check the box, you are telling Mayo Clinic that we can use your tissue  samples for research.       5. Who is in charge of the Biobank?      The Biospecimen Trust Oversight Group (BTOG) manages the Biobank. The BTOG is a  committee made up of Mayo Clinic employees from many departments.      Members of the community also have a say in how the Biobank is managed. A group of  Olmsted County residents make up the Biobanks Community Advisory Board (CAB).  The community members have been selected to represent average Biobank donors. They  are asked for their opinions about a variety of topics related to the Biobank, and they give  feedback that BTOG uses when deciding how to proceed. .      BTOG meets often to discuss these issues. BTOG exists to run the Biobank, and to make  sure that your samples and personal medical information will be safe and secure when put  into the Biobank.      6. Who will have access to the samples and  information in the Biobank?      A group within BTOG will be in charge of deciding which researchers can have access to  the samples and information in the Biobank. Even researchers who do not work at Mayo  Clinic will have to get permission from this group but they will be required to work with  a researcher at Mayo Clinic. Samples and information will only be given to researchers  who:   - Present a scientific plan for running their project  - Have had their research plans reviewed by doctors and researchers  - Intend to keep Biobank samples and information safe and secure       If the researcher has samples left when the study is over, that researcher must submit a  new plan to Mayo Clinic before using the samples in a new research study. The  researcher can destroy the leftover samples, or return them to Mayo Clinic. It is unlikely  that researchers will have any samples left.      Data from some studies may be entered into secure computer databases so they can be  shared with other researchers. The federal government requires this for research funded  by American tax payers. Researchers will have access only to information that has been  disguised. They will not have access to the original Biobank blood samples.       7. Why would I want to give to the  Biobank?      Biobank samples will serve as a resource that researchers can use for many studies. They  will sometimes learn new information after examining the samples and information in the  Biobank. When that happens, they will share the information with other scientists and  doctors. As a result, medical care may get better. In that way, it is possible that your  community could benefit from Biobank research. You should not donate to the biobank  in order to learn information about your own health.      There is no guarantee that anyone will benefit, though, and even if someone does, it may  be many years before that happens. However, you might get a good feeling from knowing  that you gave to a Biobank that supports medical research.      8. What about my privacy?      Protecting Your Privacy      None of the samples you give to the Biobank will be stored with your name, address,  Mayo Clinic number, birth date, or social security number on them. Instead, samples and  personal medical information will be assigned a unique code, and only certain members  of Mayo Clinics Biospecimen Trust Oversight Group, the group that oversees the  Biobank, will know the name that goes with each code. This way, no one will know  which sample is yours just by looking at the label.       For example:         John Smith    6185495076     . becomes .      The Biobank will be used for many years, so we cannot predict all the ways that your  sample(s) and information might be used. Your genetic information is one of a kind, like  your fingerprint, so it is impossible for us to fully hide your identity. Since a lot of people  at many institutions will have access to the Biobank, we cannot guarantee that your  information will be kept private. However, Mayo Clinic will take all reasonable measures  to protect your privacy.      The Biobank has received a Certificate of Confidentiality from the federal government.  The Certificate of Confidentiality allows Mayo Clinic to refuse to release your personal  medical information or samples even if a court orders Mayo Clinic to do so. You can still  give permission for personal information to be released.       The Certificate does not stop researchers from making required reports to the health  department. Minnesota state law requires researchers to report every case of certain  contagious diseases they find. These diseases all spread easily between people, and if you  are found to have one of the diseases named in the law, you will be told, so you can be  given treatment to help control the spread of the infection.      Authorization to Use and Disclose Protected Health Information      When you sign this form, you give researchers at Mayo Clinic permission to use and  share all the information from your samples, questionnaire, and medical record.  Sometimes samples and information will be given to researchers outside Mayo Clinic  who want to do their own studies. No personal information, such as your name, address,  and telephone number, will be allowed to leave Mayo Clinic.      Samples and information in the Biobank will only be given out for certain reasons:      1. for medical research, and  2. to make sure that all research has been done properly and reported correctly.       Protecting Your Sample(s) and Information      At Mayo Clinic, the Biobank samples are secured in a locked freezer, and access to them  is limited. The building is under constant video surveillance. Personal medical  information is stored in computers that are protected by electronic security measures.      Biobank staff will not give access to anyone unless we believe they will store your  samples and information safely, but we cannot control how the samples and information  are stored once they leave Mayo Clinic. Federal privacy regulations (HIPAA) provide  another layer of protection for your samples and information while at Mayo Clinic and  most other research centers, but do not apply everywhere.      This authorization lasts forever, or until you stop it by writing to the following address:      Mayo Clinic   Office for Human Research Protection   ATTN: Notice of Revocation of Authorization   200 1st Street SW   Rochester, MN 55905      Or by calling 866-613-2386 (toll free)      Or by e-mailing us at biobank@mayo.edu      Please remember that you cannot withdraw your samples and information from studies  that have already begun.       9. What if researchers discover something  about my health?      During individual studies, researchers could find out important information about your  health. They might discover something about your health right now, or about your risk of  getting sick in the future. Researchers will not discover something about every donor, so  you are not guaranteed to receive results.      Since decisions about health and disease are very personal, no one can predict which  results donors will want in the future. One of the important jobs that BTOG has is to  decide which research results, if any, will be returned to Biobank donors. They will make  this decision for each individual study after consulting with the appropriate researchers,  doctors, and the Community Advisory Board. Names will not be mentioned during this  process.      10. What are the risks of donating to the  Biobank?       Emotional Risks: Some questions may make you uncomfortable. If so, you may  choose not to answer those particular questions.   Physical Risks: The risks of drawing blood include pain, bruising, or infection at  the site of the needle stick. These are the same risks you face any time you have a  blood test. Often blood for the Biobank can be drawn at the same time as other  blood tests so you only have to have one needle stick.   Future Risks:    1) Loss of privacy: There is a small chance that your personal medical  information could accidentally be spread. We cannot guarantee that your  information will not be released. In this case, information could potentially be  used to discriminate against you. A federal law, the Genetic Information  Nondiscrimination Act (GINA), makes it illegal for employers and insurers to  use certain kinds of information about your genes to discriminate against you.      2) Risks related to test results:      o Deciding whether to learn results: If researchers believe they have  valuable test results, then they will ask BTOG and CAB if the results  are something that should be given to participants. This group will  also decide the best way to return results to participants.       o Learning test results: The risks of learning results can include  emotional upset, changes in family relationships, insurance or job  discrimination. It may be necessary to return to Mayo Clinic to meet  with a health care professional to get test results.     11. Will I need to pay for any of the tests  and procedures done for the Biobank?      No. You will not need to pay for a blood test that is done just for the Biobank.      However, you or your health insurance will need to pay for tests and procedures that are  done as part of your medical care.      If you have questions regarding billing, insurance or reimbursement related to  research, stop by the Admission and Business Services office or call Patient Account  Services at (800) 660-4582.      12. Will I be paid for giving to the Biobank?      When you return the completed questionnaire, you will get your choice of one or more  items worth a total of $20. These items are to recognize the time you spent giving a  blood sample and filling out the questionnaire. If an additional sample is requested you  may choose an additional item.      There is a chance that Mayo Clinic may make money from the use of your donated  sample. If that happens, you will not be offered a share of the earnings. As a not-forprofit  organization, Mayo Clinic uses all profits from products developed at Mayo to  support ongoing research and educational activities.      13. Can I find out how my samples are being  used?      No. You will not be told exactly which studies are using your samples and information.  However, we will tell you how to get general information about all the studies that are  using the Biobank. One way we will share this information is by sending all Biobank  participants a newsletter on a regular basis.       14. What happens to my sample and  information when I die?      You can withdraw your sample from the Biobank at any time during your life. Once you  die, your sample will be considered a gift you gave to Mayo Clinic. That means Mayo  Clinic can continue using it in the ways described in this consent form, even if your  family wishes that you had not donated a sample to the Biobank.      Since your samples contain your genetic information, your family may want access to  them after you die. They might use that information for many different things, such as  clarifying health risk in your family or determining if you were genetically related to  someone. It is possible that your samples will be used up during your lifetime and will  not be available to your family.      If you do not want your family to have access to your blood sample after you die, please  check the box below:       No, I do not want my family to have access to my sample after I die.      If you do not check the box, you are telling us that your legal next-of-kin has your  permission to test your sample in any way that is allowed by law.

general information about this research study study title: mayo clinic biobank name of principal investigator: dr. j. r. cerhan and colleagues researchers at mayo clinic are developing a new research resource called a biobank. participants in the biobank provide samples of blood, complete a health questionnaire, and allow access to medical records now and in the future. the biobank serves as a library for researchers; instead of having to look for volunteers for each new project, researchers can use samples from the biobank as well as share information already collected. you are being asked to give samples and information to the mayo clinic biobank, which will be used by many different researchers for many different studies. most of the researchers who use the samples and information in the biobank will be studying dna. dna is found in every cell in your body, and contains all of your genetic information. researchers know that genetic information determines things like hair and eye color, and are trying to figure out how it affects what diseases people get. do you have to participate no. participation is voluntary. your decision will not affect your health care at mayo clinic in any way. take your time before deciding whether to enroll. feel free to talk it over with your family, friends, and healthcare provider. if you do not understand any part of this consent form, please ask questions. if you choose to give samples and information to the biobank, sign this form after you have read it. your signature means you have been told about the biobank and understand that participation involves some risks. you may request that we remove your sample from the biobank at any time.  why have you been asked to participate you were asked because you were a patient at mayo clinic or one of its affiliated health systems. anyone who is at least 18 years old, has a mayo patient identifier number and is a resident of the united states can participate. why does mayo clinic want a biobank a biobank will make it much easier to conduct research studies, because researchers will have access to blood samples, along with patient data from thousands of people all in one place. it is mayo clinics hope that future research using information from the biobank will lead to improved health care. will the biobank be used for human cloning many people are worried that samples in the biobank could be used for embryonic stem cell research or human cloning. it is not possible to do embryonic stem cell research or human cloning using samples from the biobank. how many people are donating to the biobank the plan is to have 50,000 people take part in the biobank. all donors will be volunteers. 2. what will happen when i enroll in the biobank initially, you will be asked to: . provide a sample of blood (about 4 tablespoons): your blood contains dna, which has all of your genetic information. researchers are especially interested in studying dna, although many types of studies will be done using the samples in the biobank. . allow us to obtain information from your medical record: once you sign this form, researchers can review your medical records at mayo clinic now and in the future to gather medical information needed for research. looking at your records allows researchers to learn information that might be helpful during specific studies. you will not be informed if researchers look at your medical records. details about how we will keep your information private are in section 8. . complete a questionnaire about yourself: this questionnaire will take about 30 minutes to complete and will ask you about your background, environment and family history.  . return the completed materials in person or via the enclosed postage paid envelope. . if you have any questions please call us at 866-613-2386 (toll free). you may also visit our website, which can be found at: http://mayoresearch.mayo.edu/mayo/research/biobank/index.cfm) in the future, we may . occasionally ask you to fill out additional questionnaires: we may send additional questionnaires to your home. you can decide if you wish to complete and return them. biobank staff will not contact you more than twice every year (and generally much less), and such contact does not mean that anything has been learned about your health. . occasionally ask you to provide an additional blood sample: we may ask for additional samples in order to study changes in your blood over time, or because we used up the first sample you provided. if we ask you for another sample, you may always say no. 3. how long will my sample and information be kept in the biobank the biobank is a resource meant to serve the mayo clinic community for years, and there are no plans for it to end. by participating, you are agreeing to be a part of ongoing health research conducted at mayo clinic. your donation will enable researchers to examine the roots of disease for many years to come. in this consent form we talk about the sample and information you are giving to the biobank. your personal medical information is made up of the answers you give to the health questionnaire that you fill out, as well as information from your medical record. you have the right to leave the project any time. there are three ways you can do this: 1. you can decide that you no longer want researchers to contact you, but that they can keep examining your samples and personal medical information, or 2. you can ask researchers to destroy what is left of your blood sample, but allow them to keep using the information and samples you already provided, or 3. you can have your remaining samples destroyed, and tell researchers to stop using your personal medical information.  when leaving the project, please note: 1. you cannot withdraw your samples and information from studies that have already begun, 2. biobank staff cannot get back samples or medical information that have been shared with other research institutions, and 3. biobank staff will stop using your medical information if you ask us to, but we will not be able to remove existing information from our databases. if you want to leave the project, please: call us at 866-613-2386 (toll free), e-mail us at biobank@mayo.edu, or write to the following address and tell us what you want us to do with your samples and information: mayo clinic biobank attn: notice of revocation of authorization harwick 6 200 1st street sw rochester, mn 55905 if you wish to stay in the biobank, but move, please contact us with your new address so we can continue to involve you in the biobank. 4. will other samples be included in the biobank mayo clinic routinely stores tissue from surgical procedures. if you give us permission, researchers may use your tissue from either past or future procedures at mayo clinic. you will not have extra surgeries or procedures because you take part in the biobank. the amount of tissue taken by doctors for your regular medical care will not be affected by your participation. if you do not want biobank studies to use your extra tissue samples for research, please check the box below: i do not want the biobank to use my extra tissue for research if you do not check the box, you are telling mayo clinic that we can use your tissue samples for research.  5. who is in charge of the biobank the biospecimen trust oversight group (btog) manages the biobank. the btog is a committee made up of mayo clinic employees from many departments. members of the community also have a say in how the biobank is managed. a group of olmsted county residents make up the biobanks community advisory board (cab). the community members have been selected to represent average biobank donors. they are asked for their opinions about a variety of topics related to the biobank, and they give feedback that btog uses when deciding how to proceed. . btog meets often to discuss these issues. btog exists to run the biobank, and to make sure that your samples and personal medical information will be safe and secure when put into the biobank. 6. who will have access to the samples and information in the biobank a group within btog will be in charge of deciding which researchers can have access to the samples and information in the biobank. even researchers who do not work at mayo clinic will have to get permission from this group but they will be required to work with a researcher at mayo clinic. samples and information will only be given to researchers who: - present a scientific plan for running their project - have had their research plans reviewed by doctors and researchers - intend to keep biobank samples and information safe and secure if the researcher has samples left when the study is over, that researcher must submit a new plan to mayo clinic before using the samples in a new research study. the researcher can destroy the leftover samples, or return them to mayo clinic. it is unlikely that researchers will have any samples left. data from some studies may be entered into secure computer databases so they can be shared with other researchers. the federal government requires this for research funded by american tax payers. researchers will have access only to information that has been disguised. they will not have access to the original biobank blood samples.  7. why would i want to give to the biobank biobank samples will serve as a resource that researchers can use for many studies. they will sometimes learn new information after examining the samples and information in the biobank. when that happens, they will share the information with other scientists and doctors. as a result, medical care may get better. in that way, it is possible that your community could benefit from biobank research. you should not donate to the biobank in order to learn information about your own health. there is no guarantee that anyone will benefit, though, and even if someone does, it may be many years before that happens. however, you might get a good feeling from knowing that you gave to a biobank that supports medical research. 8. what about my privacy protecting your privacy none of the samples you give to the biobank will be stored with your name, address, mayo clinic number, birth date, or social security number on them. instead, samples and personal medical information will be assigned a unique code, and only certain members of mayo clinics biospecimen trust oversight group, the group that oversees the biobank, will know the name that goes with each code. this way, no one will know which sample is yours just by looking at the label. for example: john smith 6185495076 . becomes . the biobank will be used for many years, so we cannot predict all the ways that your sample(s) and information might be used. your genetic information is one of a kind, like your fingerprint, so it is impossible for us to fully hide your identity. since a lot of people at many institutions will have access to the biobank, we cannot guarantee that your information will be kept private. however, mayo clinic will take all reasonable measures to protect your privacy. the biobank has received a certificate of confidentiality from the federal government. the certificate of confidentiality allows mayo clinic to refuse to release your personal medical information or samples even if a court orders mayo clinic to do so. you can still give permission for personal information to be released.  the certificate does not stop researchers from making required reports to the health department. minnesota state law requires researchers to report every case of certain contagious diseases they find. these diseases all spread easily between people, and if you are found to have one of the diseases named in the law, you will be told, so you can be given treatment to help control the spread of the infection. authorization to use and disclose protected health information when you sign this form, you give researchers at mayo clinic permission to use and share all the information from your samples, questionnaire, and medical record. sometimes samples and information will be given to researchers outside mayo clinic who want to do their own studies. no personal information, such as your name, address, and telephone number, will be allowed to leave mayo clinic. samples and information in the biobank will only be given out for certain reasons: 1. for medical research, and 2. to make sure that all research has been done properly and reported correctly. protecting your sample(s) and information at mayo clinic, the biobank samples are secured in a locked freezer, and access to them is limited. the building is under constant video surveillance. personal medical information is stored in computers that are protected by electronic security measures. biobank staff will not give access to anyone unless we believe they will store your samples and information safely, but we cannot control how the samples and information are stored once they leave mayo clinic. federal privacy regulations (hipaa) provide another layer of protection for your samples and information while at mayo clinic and most other research centers, but do not apply everywhere. this authorization lasts forever, or until you stop it by writing to the following address: mayo clinic office for human research protection attn: notice of revocation of authorization 200 1st street sw rochester, mn 55905 or by calling 866-613-2386 (toll free) or by e-mailing us at biobank@mayo.edu please remember that you cannot withdraw your samples and information from studies that have already begun.  9. what if researchers discover something about my health during individual studies, researchers could find out important information about your health. they might discover something about your health right now, or about your risk of getting sick in the future. researchers will not discover something about every donor, so you are not guaranteed to receive results. since decisions about health and disease are very personal, no one can predict which results donors will want in the future. one of the important jobs that btog has is to decide which research results, if any, will be returned to biobank donors. they will make this decision for each individual study after consulting with the appropriate researchers, doctors, and the community advisory board. names will not be mentioned during this process. 10. what are the risks of donating to the biobank emotional risks: some questions may make you uncomfortable. if so, you may choose not to answer those particular questions. physical risks: the risks of drawing blood include pain, bruising, or infection at the site of the needle stick. these are the same risks you face any time you have a blood test. often blood for the biobank can be drawn at the same time as other blood tests so you only have to have one needle stick. future risks: 1) loss of privacy: there is a small chance that your personal medical information could accidentally be spread. we cannot guarantee that your information will not be released. in this case, information could potentially be used to discriminate against you. a federal law, the genetic information nondiscrimination act (gina), makes it illegal for employers and insurers to use certain kinds of information about your genes to discriminate against you. 2) risks related to test results: o deciding whether to learn results: if researchers believe they have valuable test results, then they will ask btog and cab if the results are something that should be given to participants. this group will also decide the best way to return results to participants. o learning test results: the risks of learning results can include emotional upset, changes in family relationships, insurance or job discrimination. it may be necessary to return to mayo clinic to meet with a health care professional to get test results.  11. will i need to pay for any of the tests and procedures done for the biobank no. you will not need to pay for a blood test that is done just for the biobank. however, you or your health insurance will need to pay for tests and procedures that are done as part of your medical care. if you have questions regarding billing, insurance or reimbursement related to research, stop by the admission and business services office or call patient account services at (800) 660-4582. 12. will i be paid for giving to the biobank when you return the completed questionnaire, you will get your choice of one or more items worth a total of $20. these items are to recognize the time you spent giving a blood sample and filling out the questionnaire. if an additional sample is requested you may choose an additional item. there is a chance that mayo clinic may make money from the use of your donated sample. if that happens, you will not be offered a share of the earnings. as a not-forprofit organization, mayo clinic uses all profits from products developed at mayo to support ongoing research and educational activities. 13. can i find out how my samples are being used no. you will not be told exactly which studies are using your samples and information. however, we will tell you how to get general information about all the studies that are using the biobank. one way we will share this information is by sending all biobank participants a newsletter on a regular basis.  14. what happens to my sample and information when i die you can withdraw your sample from the biobank at any time during your life. once you die, your sample will be considered a gift you gave to mayo clinic. that means mayo clinic can continue using it in the ways described in this consent form, even if your family wishes that you had not donated a sample to the biobank. since your samples contain your genetic information, your family may want access to them after you die. they might use that information for many different things, such as clarifying health risk in your family or determining if you were genetically related to someone. it is possible that your samples will be used up during your lifetime and will not be available to your family. if you do not want your family to have access to your blood sample after you die, please check the box below: no, i do not want my family to have access to my sample after i die. if you do not check the box, you are telling us that your legal next-of-kin has your permission to test your sample in any way that is allowed by law. we cannot absolutely guarantee that your next of kin will get access to your samples because mayo clinic will need to comply with laws existing at that time. 15. who

2019-05-13,../data//MyCode-Consent-Version-28,../data//MyCode-Consent-Version-28.txt,"IRB NUMBER: 2006-0258 IRB Approved:  10/19/2015   RESEARCH CONSENT/AUTHORIZATION FORM    TITLE OF STUDY: Geisinger MyCode® Community Health Initiative  PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATORS: DJ Carey, PhD, DH Ledbetter, PhD, WA Faucett, MS, LGC  QUESTIONS OR PROBLEMS: 1-855-636-0019 (toll free)  24-HOUR HOSPITAL SWITCHBOARD: 570-271-6211    Geisinger Clinic invites you to take part in a project called the MyCode® Community Health Initiative  (MyCode for short). By signing up for MyCode you agree to allow Geisinger to save your blood and saliva  samples and use them for research.  You also agree to allow scientists doing research with your samples to use  information in your health record.      The goal of this research is to learn more about human health and disease to find better ways to keep people  healthy and to help them when they are sick.      Please read this whole document carefully before you decide whether or not to take part in this research.  Please keep this document for your records.    THIS FORM WILL TELL YOU:   Why we are doing this research   The benefits and risks of being a part of this research   How we will collect samples of your blood or saliva    How we will use your samples for research   How we will protect your privacy     WHY DOES GEISINGER WANT TO KEEP MY BLOOD AND SALIVA SAMPLES?  Information that is in your blood or saliva can provide clues about your health and diseases you have or might  get.  Geisinger doctors and scientists want to do research to find these clues and learn how to use them to  improve health.     Some of these clues are found in your DNA (which is also known as deoxyribonucleic acid). DNA makes up  your genes. Genes provide instructions for things like eye or hair color, height, and sometimes things that affect  health.   Everyone’s DNA is slightly different.  By studying the DNA of many different people and comparing it  to information in their health records we hope to find differences in DNA that help people stay healthy or in  some cases get sick.  Your blood also contains proteins and other chemicals that can provide clues about your  health and we may also study those.      Many people are needed to provide samples to do this research.  We have samples from tens of thousands of  Geisinger patients, and plan to collect more. Our goal is to enroll up to 500,000 Geisinger patients in this  project.      MyCode is a project of Geisinger Clinic.  MyCode activities (such as collecting, storing, or testing samples)  may be paid for by the following sources:    Geisinger’s own funds;   Government grants;   Grants from non-profit agencies that support research; and/or   Commercial partners (such as drug companies)       Study: 2006-0258  Version Number: 28  Date: 10/16/15  Page 1 of 6    IRB NUMBER: 2006-0258 IRB Approved:  10/19/2015     WHAT WILL HAPPEN WHEN I PARTICIPATE IN MYCODE?  When you agree to participate in MyCode, you give us permission to:   Collect samples of your saliva or blood (not more than 2 tablespoons at a time) and store them in a  biobank, which is a safe, secure place for storing the samples    Use your samples for research studies that we approve; This might include studies that analyze your  DNA (your genes)   Use information from your Geisinger medical record for research studies that we approve; This  information might include diseases you have, medicines you take, and results of medical tests you get   Contact you in the future to get more information or tell you about other research studies     Tell you about results we get from studying your samples that might help you     HOW WILL YOU COLLECT MY MYCODE SAMPLES?  There are several ways we might collect your samples;    A phlebotomist will collect a blood sample when you are having blood drawn because your doctor  ordered tests   You can volunteer to provide MyCode blood samples when you aren’t already having blood drawn for  test your doctor has ordered   You might be asked to provide a saliva (spit) sample using a kit we will provide     WILL GEISINGER SHARE MY SAMPLES AND MY INFORMATION?  Your samples and the information that we get from studying your samples or your medical record may be  shared with other researchers. These researchers may work for:   Geisinger;    Universities or medical schools, or other research facilities;   Government agencies like the National Institutes of Health (NIH);   Public agencies, foundations or other groups that conduct or sponsor research; or   Companies that do medical research, like drug companies      Researchers must get permission to use your samples and information from two Geisinger  committees - the  Geisinger Institutional Review Board and the MyCode Governing Board.     The Geisinger Institutional Review Board is responsible for reviewing research that involves people. They  decide if the research is done in a way that:   Limits the possible harm to the participants;   Makes sure that the risks of participating are reasonable; and   Protects your privacy    The MyCode Governing Board makes sure that research that uses your samples and information will:   Be a good use of the samples and information in the MyCode biobank and   Help us learn more about health and disease    HOW WILL YOU PROTECT MY PRIVACY?  In most cases, researchers do not need information that could identify you when they are doing research using  your MyCode samples and data.  Your samples and research data will be given a special code or study  identification (ID) number. These ID numbers will be used to label samples and data when they are used for  research, instead of information like your name or birth date that could be used to identify you.     Study: 2006-0258  Version Number: 28  Date: 10/16/15  Page 2 of 6    IRB NUMBER: 2006-0258 IRB Approved:  10/19/2015 Information that links you to your ID number will be kept in a secure file that is protected by Geisinger.  Only a  few people on the MyCode team will have access to this file.  All of these people have been trained to protect  your information.  Information that can identify you will be given to Geisinger researchers only when it is  necessary for the research, and with the approval of the Geisinger Institutional Review Board and the MyCode  Governing Board.      If a non-Geisinger researcher wants information that identifies you, then a member of the MyCode team will  contact you to see if you want to learn more about the study the researcher is doing.  If you agree to learn more  about their study, then the MyCode team will give the researcher your contact information.  Then the researcher  will contact you to tell you more about their study.  You have the right to decide whether or not:   You want to learn more about their study   You want to take part in their study    All researchers who use MyCode samples or information are required to protect your privacy.      We will not tell you every time your samples and/or information are used for research projects.     WHO ELSE HAS THE RIGHT TO ACCESS MY PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION?  Protected health information (PHI) is information about your health or your medical care that was collected  by a healthcare provider (like Geisinger) that can be used to identify you.    Federal and state laws are in place to protect your PHI.  Geisinger has departments that are responsible for  making sure researchers follow these and other laws. Staff members in these departments may look at your  research records to make sure we are following these laws.       Your PHI may be shared if it is required by law. Regulatory organizations may inspect and/or copy your  research records (including information in your medical record) for quality assurance. These organizations  include the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. These  organizations must follow federal laws to protect your privacy when we are required to share your information.    The chance that Geisinger will be required to share your PHI with these agencies is small. If your PHI is shared  outside of Geisinger, then some federal privacy laws may not apply.  Some of these laws only apply to  hospitals, doctors’ offices, and other healthcare providers.      Geisinger will make every effort to protect your PHI, but we cannot absolutely guarantee that your information  will be safe.     Some genetic information that is uncovered by studying your DNA is unique to you (like fingerprints). When  your genetic information is shared, we will make every effort to protect it. Researchers will promise not to try to  identify you using any information they are given. The chance of anyone identifying you is small.     ARE THERE BENEFITS TO BEING A PART OF THIS PROJECT?  The main benefit of being a part of MyCode is helping researchers learn more about human health and disease.   This will lead to better ways to treat disease and keep people healthy.      There is a chance that researchers might find information that could be important to your health (and the health  of your family members) when they study your MyCode samples. Based on what we know today, we will find  information that will be useful for medical care in only about 2% (1 in 50) of MyCode participants. The chance  of finding information important to your health will increase as we learn more about health and disease.     Study: 2006-0258  Version Number: 28  Date: 10/16/15  Page 3 of 6    IRB NUMBER: 2006-0258 IRB Approved:  10/19/2015 Geisinger has a team of experts who will decide what research results should be given to MyCode participants  and how we should tell them. Examples of such research results are increased risk of developing serious  diseases like heart disease or cancer or how a person might respond to a medicine.      We will only inform you when we find information that we believe can be helpful in your medical care. At this  time we will not tell you about health problems for which there are no medical treatments  (like Alzheimer’s  disease or Huntington’s disease).     Geisinger is committed to helping you understand and use the information that we might return to you as a  result of your participation in MyCode.      Research that uses your samples and information may not be finished quickly. There is a chance that you will  not hear from any researchers. If you do not hear from anyone on the MyCode team:   Your sample may not have been studied yet OR   You may not have any of the gene changes that we are studying at this time     WHAT HAPPENS IF A RESEARCHER FINDS INFORMATION THAT COULD BE IMPORTANT  FOR MY HEALTH CARE?  If we find information that we think you should know to help your medical care, then we will:   Tell you about the research result and what it means for your health;   Tell your healthcare provider;    Put this information in your medical record; and   Work with you to make sure that you understand what you should do about this information    Information about your increased chances for a health problem may be important for your parents, your  children, and/or your siblings. If you give us permission to contact your family, then the MyCode team will  work with you to make sure that your family members also benefit from this information. If your family  members are not Geisinger patients, then we will help them contact genetic professionals near where they live  who can help them. You and your family members will:   Get information that tells you what we found in your sample   Get information that explains why you have a higher chance of having a health problem    Be able to call or email licensed genetic counselors who can give you more information     The initial information and support Geisinger gives you will be free of charge.  Any appointments or testing that  you choose to have done because of your increased chance will be billed to you and/or your health insurance  provider.     ARE THERE ANY RISKS TO BEING A PART OF THIS PROJECT?  There are no risks involved in giving a saliva sample.     If you give a blood sample for MyCode there is a small risk of bleeding, bruising, infection at the needle site, or  fainting (this is rare).      If we tell you that you have a higher chance of having a health problem because of something we discover from  studying your sample, then there is a risk that you might be surprised or upset.    There is a chance that your MyCode samples and information may be shared or used inappropriately. Geisinger  takes the protection of your privacy very seriously and works hard to keep your information safe.  We cannot  guarantee that your information will be kept private. We think the risk of your information being shared or used  inappropriately is small. We also do not know every possible risk that might come up in the future.  Study: 2006-0258  Version Number: 28  Date: 10/16/15  Page 4 of 6    IRB NUMBER: 2006-0258 IRB Approved:  10/19/2015 CAN MY GENETIC INFORMATION BE USED AGAINST ME?  The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) is a federal law that makes it illegal for some  companies to use genetic information against you. These companies include:   Health insurance companies   Group health plans   Most employers    The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act does not protect against discrimination by companies that sell  life, disability, or long-term care insurance. At this time, the chances we would be required to share your genetic  information with companies like this are small.    DOES BEING IN THE STUDY COST ME ANYTHING?  There is no extra cost to you or to your insurance company for being a part of MyCode.     If you are one of the people who get information from MyCode about your health, then medical appointments  or testing you choose to have done because of this information will be billed to you and/or your health  insurance provider. For example, if we find that you have an increased chance of getting breast cancer, then  your doctor may want you to have mammograms more often than most women. The cost of these mammograms  may be covered by your health insurance policy or you may have to pay for them.     WHAT ARE MY RIGHTS AS A PARTICIPANT?  Being a part of this project is your choice. If you decide to participate now, but change your mind at any time  later, then you can then withdraw from MyCode. Your decision will have no effect on the medical care you  receive from Geisinger.     If you wish to stop and no longer participate in MyCode, please write or call us using the contact information  below. If you choose to call, we will send you a form to sign and return to us to complete the withdrawal  process.   Phone: 1-855-636-0019  Address: MyCode  100 North Academy Avenue  Danville, PA 17822-2630    If you choose to stop being a part of MyCode we will not collect any new samples or information from you.   Your samples in the MyCode biobank will be destroyed. If your information has been shared with researchers,  then these researchers may keep using the information they have for research.    You will not own any information, medical tests, medicines, or other products that are created from research  that used samples and information from MyCode. You will not get any of these products for free or get any  money or other payment from the sale of any such product(s).     For questions about your rights as a research participant, please contact the Geisinger Institutional Review  Board at 570-271-8663. When you call them, please give them the study number 2006-0258.    HOW LONG WILL THIS STUDY LAST?  There is no planned end date for MyCode.  Your samples and information will be kept until they are no longer  useful for research, or the project ends.

you to make sure that you understand what you should do about this information information about your increased chances for a health problem may be important for your parents, your children, and/or your siblings. if you give us permission to contact your family, then the mycode team will work with you to make sure that your family members also benefit from this information. if your family members are not geisinger patients, then we will help them contact genetic professionals near where they live who can help them. you and your family members will: get information that tells you what we found in your sample get information that explains why you have a higher chance of having a health problem be able to call or email licensed genetic counselors who can give you more information the initial information and support geisinger gives you will be free of charge. any appointments or testing that you choose to have done because of your increased chance will be billed to you and/or your health insurance provider. are there any risks to being a part of this project there are no risks involved in giving a saliva sample. if you give a blood sample for mycode there is a small risk of bleeding, bruising, infection at the needle site, or fainting (this is rare). if we tell you that you have a higher chance of having a health problem because of something we discover from studying your sample, then there is a risk that you might be surprised or upset. there is a chance that your mycode samples and information may be shared or used inappropriately. geisinger takes the protection of your privacy very seriously and works hard to keep your information safe. we cannot guarantee that your information will be kept private. we think the risk of your information being shared or used inappropriately is small. we also do not know every possible risk that might come up in the future. study: 2006-0258 version number: 28 date: 10/16/15 page 4 of 6 irb number: 2006-0258 irb approved:

against you. these companies include: health insurance companies group health plans most employers the genetic information nondiscrimination act does not protect against discrimination by companies that sell life, disability, or long-term care insurance. at this time, the chances we would be required to share your genetic information with companies like this are small. does being in the study cost me anything there is no extra cost to you or to your insurance company for being a part of mycode. if you are one of the people who get information from mycode about your health, then medical appointments or testing you choose to have done because of this information will be billed to you and/or your health insurance provider. for example, if we find that you have an increased chance of getting breast cancer, then your doctor may want you to have mammograms more often than most women. the cost of these mammograms may be covered by your health insurance policy or you may have to pay for them. what are my rights as a participant being a part of this project is your choice. if you decide to participate now, but change your mind at any time later, then you can then withdraw from mycode. your decision will have no effect on the medical care you receive from geisinger. if you wish to stop and no longer participate in mycode, please write or call us using the contact information

The purpose of the TCGA project is to discover genetic  changes associated with cancer.  This knowledge should lead to better ways to prevent,  detect, and treat cancer and, perhaps, other diseases as well.  This project is being  sponsored by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the National Human Genome  Research Institute (NHGRI).  The NCI and the NHGRI are both part of the US  government agency known as the National Institutes of Health (NIH).    Body tissues are made up of cells.  Cells contain DNA, which is part of your unique  genetic material that carries the instructions for your body’s development and function.   Cancer can result from changes in a person’s genetic material that causes cells to divide  in an uncontrolled way and, sometimes, to travel to other organs.  Currently, researchers  and doctors know some of the genetic changes that can cause cancer, but they do not  know all of them.      The TCGA project is designed to try to identify all of the genetic changes that can cause  cancer in people.  Therefore, since you are having surgery to remove a cancer, we would  like to study the genetic and biochemical material from your cancer tissue as part of the  TCGA.  We will compare the genetic and biochemical material from your cancer tissue  to the genetic and biochemical material from your normal tissue to find the differences  that exist.  By combining this information with information from your medical records, it  may be possible to identify the genetic changes that are associated with your particular  type of cancer.  We will perform this same process with many hundreds of other people  who have also volunteered to be in this research project.  By studying many different  kinds of cancer in this way, we expect to identify most of the genetic changes associated  with different kinds of cancer.  Since we will combine genetic and biochemical  information with information from medical records, such as how cancers respond to  different kinds of treatments, this project could lead to more knowledge about why  certain cancers respond differently or don’t respond at all.  With such knowledge, future  treatments could become customized to a patient’s unique genetic make-up.    Description of the Research   We are requesting your permission to use your cancer tissue, some of your normal tissue,  and information from your medical records in this study.  The following sections describe  how your tissue samples and information will be collected and studied if you give us  permission to include you in this study.      Collection of Your Samples and Medical Information   Your scheduled surgery is part of the medical treatment that you agreed upon with  your doctor.  Your surgery is not part of the TCGA research project.  During   1  surgery, cancer tissue will be removed, and usually, when cancer tissue is  removed, very small amounts of nearby normal tissue also are removed.  After the  pathology department takes the tissue they need for your diagnosis, we will  receive some of the extra cancer and normal tissues that would normally be  thrown away.   We also will collect a second type of normal tissue (blood) from you by drawing  about 4 tablespoons of blood from a vein in your arm.   If you object to having blood drawn, we will collect some normal tissue from you  by swabbing cells from the inside of your cheeks or saliva from which genetic  material can be collected.    We also will collect information from your medical records, including your age,  ethnic background, diagnosis, disease history, medical treatments, and response to  treatments.          Coding of Your Tissue Samples and Medical Information   Your tissues, blood sample, and medical information will be labeled with a code  number.   Only Dr. ____________ at (Institution) will have the information that matches the  code to traditionally-used identifying information, such as your name, address,  phone number, or social security number.  Dr. ___ will keep the information that  matches the code to this traditionally-used identifying information in a  safeguarded database.  Only very few, authorized people, who have specifically  agreed to protect your identity, will have access to this database.  All other  researchers and personnel, including those who will be working with your  samples and medical information, will not have access to any of the traditionally- used identifying information about you.     Analysis of Your Samples and Medical Information   Your coded tissue samples will be sent to an NCI-sponsored storage facility,  currently known as the Biospecimen Core Resource (BCR).  The samples will be  processed there and portions of your samples then will be sent to different types  of laboratories as part of this project.  One type of laboratory will analyze your  DNA by a method called sequencing.  Other types of laboratories will study other  biochemical material from your samples by different methods.  The remaining  portions of your samples, if any, will be stored in the BCR for an unlimited period  of time for future use in research related to cancer or, perhaps, in other research  projects.   Information from analyses of your samples and your medical information will be  put into databases along with information from the other people who volunteered  for this project.  These databases will be accessible by the Internet in two ways:  o Some of the results from the analysis will be mixed with results from other  participants and put in a completely public database, available to anyone  on the Internet.  This information will not be specific to you or any other  participant.  o The other database is private, and will include person-by-person coded  genetic, biochemical and medical information.  The results in this database   2  will be available to the global biomedical research community, but the  access is controlled.   Only researchers who have received approval from  an NIH Data Access Committee will be authorized to access this database.     Please note that traditionally-used identifying information about you, such as your  name, address, telephone number, or social security number, will NOT be put into  either the public or controlled-access databases for this project.    Recontact    In the future, we may want to obtain additional samples or more information about your  health or medical care.  Right now, we are just asking your permission to recontact you if  this should be needed.  If you say yes, a person from (Institution) would contact you in  the future to ask whether you would be interested in participating in this additional  research.    Payment and Costs     You will not be paid to participate in this project.  Your tissue samples and your medical  information will be used only for research purposes and will not be sold.  It is possible  that some of the research conducted using your samples or information eventually will  lead to the development of new diagnostic tests, new drugs or other commercial products.   Should this occur, you will not receive any part of the profits generated from such  products.    You will not incur any costs from participating in this project.  The chance that you will  be physically injured as a result of participating in this project is very small.  However, if  you are physically injured as a result of participating in this project, emergency medical  treatment for your research-related injury will be provided to you at no cost.     Potential Benefits of Participating in the Project    You should not expect to personally benefit from this research.  The main reason you  may want to participate is to help researchers and health professionals around the world  to better understand the causes of cancer and other diseases so that they can find better  ways to prevent, detect, treat, and cure such illnesses.    Potential Risks of Participating in the Project    Physical Risks    There are very few physical risks associated with this project.  Possible side effects  from drawing the blood sample include mild pain, bleeding, bruising, and infection at  the site of the needle insertion.  Fainting or light-headedness can sometimes occur,  but usually lasts only a few minutes.      3  Psychological or Social Risks Associated with Loss of Privacy   Your privacy is very important to us and we will use many safety measures to  protect your privacy.  However, in spite of all of the safety measures that we will  use, we cannot guarantee that your identity will never become known.  Although  your genetic information is unique to you, you do share some genetic information  with your children, parents, brothers, sisters, and other relatives.  Consequently, it  may be possible that genetic information from them could be used to help identify  you.  Similarly, it may be possible that genetic information from you could be  used to help identify them.     While neither the public nor the controlled-access databases developed for this  project will contain information that is traditionally used to identify you, such as  your name, address, telephone number, or social security number, people may  develop ways in the future that would allow someone to link your genetic or  medical information in our databases back to you.  For example, someone could  compare information in our databases with information from you (or a relative) in  another database and be able to identify you (or your relative).  It also is possible  that there could be violations to the security of the computer systems used to store  the codes linking your genetic and medical information to you.     Since some genetic variations can help to predict the future health problems of  you and your relatives, this information might be of interest to employers, health  providers, insurance companies, and others.  Patterns of genetic variation also can  be used by law enforcement agencies to identify a person or his/her relatives.   Therefore, your genetic information potentially could be used in ways that could  cause you or your family distress, such as by revealing that you (or a relative)  carry a genetic disease or by leading to the denial of employment or insurance for  you (or a relative).     There also may be other privacy risks that we have not foreseen.      While we believe that the risks to you and your family are very low, we are unable to tell  you exactly what all of the risks are.  In 2008, the federal government established the  Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA), a law that prohibits genetic  discrimination in employment and health insurance. It is important to note that while this  law protects you from certain kinds of genetic discrimination, there are exceptions.  For  example, GINA does not apply to employers with fewer than 15 employees.  Additionally, this law does not protect you from genetic discrimination in life, disability,  or long-term care insurance.  [Note to PI/IRB: insert state/local laws reference that may  offer additional protections to safeguard patients’ genetic information and prevent genetic  discrimination.]     Keeping Your Information Confidential    We will make every attempt to protect the confidentiality of your information.  This  signed consent form will be stored in a locked file that will be accessible only to a very  small number of authorized people involved in this project.       4  To help us protect the confidentiality of your information, we have obtained a Certificate  of Confidentiality from the National Institutes of Health.  With this Certificate, we cannot  be forced to disclose information that may identify you, even by a court order, in any  federal, state, or local civil, criminal, administrative, legislative, or other proceedings.   We will use this Certificate to resist any demands for information that would identify  you, with the following exceptions:     The Certificate cannot be used to resist a request for your information from the  United States Government when the information is to be used for auditing or  evaluation of federally funded projects or for information that must be disclosed  to meet the requirements of the federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA).     The Certificate does not prevent you or a member of your family from voluntarily  releasing information about yourself or your involvement in this research.  Also,  if you have given written consent to an insurer, employer, or other person to  receive research information, then we may not use the Certificate to withhold that  information.    Project Results    Your individual results from this research project will not be given back to you or put  into your medical records.      If research from this project is published in professional journals, it will not include  traditionally-used identifying information, such as your name, address, telephone  number, or social security number.  Some publications from this project will be found at  the www.cancergenome.nih.gov website.    Voluntary Participation     The choice to participate in this research by donating your tissues and medical  information is completely up to you. No matter what you decide to do, your decision  will not affect your medical care.    Alternatives to Participating in the Project    The alternative option is not to participate.        5  Withdrawal from the Project    You may stop being part of this research project at any time and for any reason.

",56,"the cancer genome atlas (tcga) suggested informed consent language for prospective collections 2011 purpose of the project we would like to ask your permission to include you in a research project called the cancer genome atlas (tcga). the purpose of the tcga project is to discover genetic changes associated with cancer. this knowledge should lead to better ways to prevent, detect, and treat cancer and, perhaps, other diseases as well. this project is being sponsored by the national cancer institute (nci) and the national human genome research institute (nhgri). the nci and the nhgri are both part of the us government agency known as the national institutes of health (nih). body tissues are made up of cells. cells contain dna, which is part of your unique genetic material that carries the instructions for your body s development and function. cancer can result from changes in a person s genetic material that causes cells to divide in an uncontrolled way and, sometimes, to travel to other organs. currently, researchers and doctors know some of the genetic changes that can cause cancer, but they do not know all of them. the tcga project is designed to try to identify all of the genetic changes that can cause cancer in people. therefore, since you are having surgery to remove a cancer, we would like to study the genetic and biochemical material from your cancer tissue as part of the tcga. we will compare the genetic and biochemical material from your cancer tissue to the genetic and biochemical material from your normal tissue to find the differences that exist. by combining this information with information from your medical records, it may be possible to identify the genetic changes that are associated with your particular type of cancer. we will perform this same process with many hundreds of other people who have also volunteered to be in this research project. by studying many different kinds of cancer in this way, we expect to identify most of the genetic changes associated with different kinds of cancer. since we will combine genetic and biochemical information with information from medical records, such as how cancers respond to different kinds of treatments, this project could lead to more knowledge about why certain cancers respond differently or don t respond at all. with such knowledge, future treatments could become customized to a patient s unique genetic make-up. description of the research we are requesting your permission to use your cancer tissue, some of your normal tissue, and information from your medical records in this study. the following sections describe how your tissue samples and information will be collected and studied if you give us permission to include you in this study. collection of your samples and medical information your scheduled surgery is part of the medical treatment that you agreed upon with your doctor. your surgery is not part of the tcga research project. during 1 surgery, cancer tissue will be removed, and usually, when cancer tissue is removed, very small amounts of nearby normal tissue also are removed. after the pathology department takes the tissue they need for your diagnosis, we will receive some of the extra cancer and normal tissues that would normally be thrown away. we also will collect a second type of normal tissue (blood) from you by drawing about 4 tablespoons of blood from a vein in your arm. if you object to having blood drawn, we will collect some normal tissue from you by swabbing cells from the inside of your cheeks or saliva from which genetic material can be collected. we also will collect information from your medical records, including your age, ethnic background, diagnosis, disease history, medical treatments, and response to treatments. coding of your tissue samples and medical information your tissues, blood sample, and medical information will be labeled with a code number. only dr.  at (institution) will have the information that matches the code to traditionally-used identifying information, such as your name, address, phone number, or social security number. dr.  will keep the information that matches the code to this traditionally-used identifying information in a safeguarded database. only very few, authorized people, who have specifically agreed to protect your identity, will have access to this database. all other researchers and personnel, including those who will be working with your samples and medical information, will not have access to any of the traditionally- used identifying information about you. analysis of your samples and medical information your coded tissue samples will be sent to an nci-sponsored storage facility, currently known as the biospecimen core resource (bcr). the samples will be processed there and portions of your samples then will be sent to different types of laboratories as part of this project. one type of laboratory will analyze your dna by a method called sequencing. other types of laboratories will study other biochemical material from your samples by different methods. the remaining portions of your samples, if any, will be stored in the bcr for an unlimited period of time for future use in research related to cancer or, perhaps, in other research projects. information from analyses of your samples and your medical information will be put into databases along with information from the other people who volunteered for this project. these databases will be accessible by the internet in two ways: o some of the results from the analysis will be mixed with results from other participants and put in a completely public database, available to anyone on the internet. this information will not be specific to you or any other participant. o the other database is private, and will include person-by-person coded genetic, biochemical and medical information. the results in this database 2 will be available to the global biomedical research community, but the access is controlled. only researchers who have received approval from an nih data access committee will be authorized to access this database. please note that traditionally-used identifying information about you, such as your name, address, telephone number, or social security number, will not be put into either the public or controlled-access databases for this project. recontact in the future, we may want to obtain additional samples or more information about your health or medical care. right now, we are just asking your permission to recontact you if this should be needed. if you say yes, a person from (institution) would contact you in the future to ask whether you would be interested in participating in this additional research. payment and costs you will not be paid to participate in this project. your tissue samples and your medical information will be used only for research purposes and will not be sold. it is possible that some of the research conducted using your samples or information eventually will lead to the development of new diagnostic tests, new drugs or other commercial products. should this occur, you will not receive any part of the profits generated from such products. you will not incur any costs from participating in this project. the chance that you will be physically injured as a result of participating in this project is very small. however, if you are physically injured as a result of participating in this project, emergency medical treatment for your research-related injury will be provided to you at no cost. potential benefits of participating in the project you should not expect to personally benefit from this research. the main reason you may want to participate is to help researchers and health professionals around the world to better understand the causes of cancer and other diseases so that they can find better ways to prevent, detect, treat, and cure such illnesses. potential risks of participating in the project physical risks there are very few physical risks associated with this project. possible side effects from drawing the blood sample include mild pain, bleeding, bruising, and infection at the site of the needle insertion. fainting or light-headedness can sometimes occur, but usually lasts only a few minutes. 3 psychological or social risks associated with loss of privacy your privacy is very important to us and we will use many safety measures to protect your privacy. however, in spite of all of the safety measures that we will use, we cannot guarantee that your identity will never become known. although your genetic information is unique to you, you do share some genetic information with your children, parents, brothers, sisters, and other relatives. consequently, it may be possible that genetic information from them could be used to help identify you. similarly, it may be possible that genetic information from you could be used to help identify them. while neither the public nor the controlled-access databases developed for this project will contain information that is traditionally used to identify you, such as your name, address, telephone number, or social security number, people may develop ways in the future that would allow someone to link your genetic or medical information in our databases back to you. for example, someone could compare information in our databases with information from you (or a relative) in another database and be able to identify you (or your relative). it also is possible that there could be violations to the security of the computer systems used to store the codes linking your genetic and medical information to you. since some genetic variations can help to predict the future health problems of you and your relatives, this information might be of interest to employers, health providers, insurance companies, and others. patterns of genetic variation also can be used by law enforcement agencies to identify a person or his/her relatives. therefore, your genetic information potentially could be used in ways that could cause you or your family distress, such as by revealing that you (or a relative) carry a genetic disease or by leading to the denial of employment or insurance for you (or a relative). there also may be other privacy risks that we have not foreseen. while we believe that the risks to you and your family are very low, we are unable to tell you exactly what all of the risks are. in 2008, the federal government established the genetic information nondiscrimination act (gina), a law that prohibits genetic discrimination in employment and health insurance. it is important to note that while this law protects you from certain kinds of genetic discrimination, there are exceptions. for example, gina does not apply to employers with fewer than 15 employees. additionally, this law does not protect you from genetic discrimination in life, disability, or long-term care insurance. [note to pi/irb: insert state/local laws reference that may offer additional protections to safeguard patients genetic information and prevent genetic discrimination.] keeping your information confidential we will make every attempt to protect the confidentiality of your information. this signed consent form will be stored in a locked file that will be accessible only to a very small number of authorized people involved in this project. 4 to help us protect the confidentiality of your information, we have obtained a certificate of confidentiality from the national institutes of health. with this certificate, we cannot be forced to disclose information that may identify you, even by a court order, in any federal, state, or local civil, criminal, administrative, legislative, or other proceedings. we will use this certificate to resist any demands for information that would identify you, with the following exceptions: the certificate cannot be used to resist a request for your information from the united states government when the information is to be used for auditing or evaluation of federally funded projects or for information that must be disclosed to meet the requirements of the federal food and drug administration (fda). the certificate does not prevent you or a member of your family from voluntarily releasing information about yourself or your involvement in this research. also, if you have given written consent to an insurer, employer, or other person to receive research information, then we may not use the certificate to withhold that information. project results your individual results from this research project will not be given back to you or put into your medical records. if research from this project is published in professional journals, it will not include traditionally-used identifying information, such as your name, address, telephone number, or social security number. some publications from this project will be found at the www.cancergenome.nih.gov website. voluntary participation the choice to participate in this research by donating your tissues and medical information is completely up to you. no matter what you decide to do, your decision will not affect your medical care. alternatives to participating in the project the alternative option is not to participate. 5 withdrawal from the project you may stop being part of this research project at any time and for any reason. if you wish to withdraw, please contact the person named below. if you withdraw, we will stop collecting any of your information and will no longer distribute your samples to anyone they will be discarded. however, please understand that, even if you do withdraw, once your samples have been distributed to the participating research centers and your information transferred to the databases, it will not be possible to discard your samples or remove your information from this research project. if you withdraw from this project, it will in no way affect the care you receive from this hospital. contact information if you have any questions about the project or your participation, [please use specific institutional language here, but do not automatically promise ability to withdraw]. agreeing to participate in the project to participate in this research, you must agree to all of the following

You are being asked to participate in this research study because you have been diagnosed with Susac  Syndrome (SuS).       Why Is This Study Being Done?    The primary purpose of this study is to collect detailed clinical information on as many patients (past,  present, and future) with SuS as possible, from around the world. The information collected includes  CCF IRB #: 13-188 Approval Date: 3/7/2015 Expiration Date: 3/6/2016 information about initial symptoms, the course of the disease, response to treatment, eventual outcome,  and the impact the disease has had on patient’s lives and family members.  Analysis of this information  will help us to better understand this disease and to provide better care for current and future patients  with SuS.      How Many People Will Take Part In The Study?  About 150 people, from all over the world, will take part in this study, which is being conducted by the  Susac Syndrome Team at Cleveland Clinic.           What Is Involved In The Study?    There are two main components to the ICS­­­the International Disease Registry (IDR) and the  Comprehensive Database Project (CDP):       ·  International Disease Registry (IDR):  The IDR collects very limited “basic information” on as  many patients as possible from around the world. This “basic information” is limited to the  following:  o  Patient’s age at time of disease onset  o  Patient’s age at the time of diagnosis  o  Patient’s gender  o  Patient’s current country of residence  o  Patient’s home country  o  Ethnicity of patient’s parents  o  Which of the following did the patient’s SuS involve: brain? eyes? ears?    A specific short IDR Form has been developed to “capture” the above information on a  participating patient. The patient (or family) completes the form as best they can and sends it  to Dr. Rennebohm.  After receiving the IDR form, Dr. Rennebohm attaches an anonymous  code number to it, and enters it into the Registry (IDR).   (Based on future information he  receives from the patient, Dr. Rennebohm will verify the information the patient has entered  on the IDR form and add any missing information.)  No patient identifying information is  entered into the Registry.  Only Dr. Rennebohm will know the name of the patient associated  with the code number.  Please see the IDR Research Information Sheet for more details.  The  IDR requires minimal time, effort, and commitment on the part of the patient and no effort on  the part of the patient’s physician.  It is anticipated that some patients may want to participate  only in this component of the ICS.     ·  The Comprehensive Database Project (CDP): Compared to the IDR, this project is designed to  collect much more extensive and detailed information and requires more time, effort, and  commitment on the part of the patient.  Patients and family members will be asked to  periodically complete data collection forms, most of which are self­report questionnaires.   These forms are designed to document how you were doing at the onset of your SuS, how your  illness changed once you were started on the medications prescribed by your personal  physician, how you were doing at your last visit with your physician, and how you are doing  now.  In addition to being asked to complete forms, you may be contacted (by Dr. Rennebohm  Version Date: V2, 24OCT14  Page 2 of 7        CCF IRB #: 13-188 Approval Date: 3/7/2015 Expiration Date: 3/6/2016 and/or his research staff, via email or phone) to discuss other aspects of your experience with  SuS­­­e.g. how it has affected your life, what medications seemed most valuable to you, how  you think care for SuS can be improved, etc.   By reviewing other information the patient has  sent (e.g. a CD of MRI studies), Dr. Rennebohm (and/or his research team at Cleveland Clinic)  will complete other data collection forms regarding your experience with SuS.   Please see our  Cleveland Clinic Educational Website on Susac Syndrome (google: clevelandclinic.org/susac)  for more information about sub­projects of the Comprehensive Database Project.  Patients  may participate in this project at whatever level they would like­­­from minimum  participation in only one sub­project, to maximum participation in all sub­projects.  The  patient chooses their level of commitment, and this level can change as they see fit.     Patients will need to sign this Patient Consent Form (the one you are now reading) before participating  in either of the above components of the ICS.  This Patient Consent Form allows you to clearly indicate  whether you are consenting to participate in the “IDR only” or in the “IDR and the Comprehensive  Database Project.”  (Please see the two boxes at the end of this Form and check one or the other.)     For participation in either component, you will be asked to send relevant parts of your medical records  to Dr. Rennebohm.  This may include copies of your physicians’ notes and dictations, hospitalization  summaries, a CD containing your actual MRI images, ophthalmology reports and images, and  audiograms. Once received, these records will be de­identified, kept confidential and kept under lock  and key.  Before patients send these medical records to Dr. Rennebohm, they will need to sign a  Release of Medical Records Form­­­one provided by Cleveland Clinic and one provided by their home  physicians (for your home physicians’ purposes).    This study does not involve testing of new treatments.  It is not a clinical trial. The Cleveland Clinic  Educational Website on Susac Syndrome, which is associated with the study, provides you and your  personal physician with an up­to­date review of various treatment options for Susac Syndrome,  including suggested guidelines for the treatment and long­term management of SuS­­­all for you and  your personal physician’s consideration.  You and your personal physician will decide on your own,  however, how you would like to have your personal case of Susac syndrome treated.  Enrollment and  continued participation in the study may occur regardless of treatment decisions made by you and your  personal physician.  You may drop out of the study at any time.    Our Cleveland Clinic Educational Website on Susac Syndrome fully explains the ICS, provides  educational materials about SuS, facilitates enrollment of patients from around the world, and provides  a uniform set of disease assessment forms. Patients, as well as physicians who are caring for (or have  cared for) patients with SuS, will be able to access the SuS Website for treatment and management  guidelines, for the specific set of uniform data collection forms and disease assessment questionnaires,  and for directions for participation in the ICS. These forms and instruments, which may be downloaded  from the Website, were initially designed to help physicians during the day­to­day care of their patient  with SuS, but will now also be employed to facilitate data collection for research purposes.      A key strategy of the ICS is to enable, empower, and enlist patients to efficiently provide quality data  about their experiences with SuS­­­i.e. this is a patient­driven study, in which patients serve as patient­ researchers, for the sake of future patients.    Bio­Bank Projects:

In addition to studying clinical aspects of Susac syndrome, a third component of the ICS is the  collection of research samples for the analysis of novel biomarkers that may potentially aid in either  the diagnosis of Susac syndrome or in assessment of disease activity.     We may be asking to do a blood draw (about 4 tablespoons) for biomarker analysis, and ask your  permission to store any unused CSF from clinical samples for future analysis.  Specimens will be  collected and processed into either 0.5 ml or 1.0 ml aliquots, boxed, and stored in a minus 70 degree C  freezer on site.  Funding will be supported by the Fasenmyer Center, directed by Dr. Calabrese.    You will NOT have any biopsy or other procedures done specifically for the purpose of this study aside  from blood collection as this collection is being done solely for research purposes. However, if you do  have, or have had, a procedure such as a biopsy done, we are requesting that you allow us to use excess  tissue which would otherwise be thrown away (surgical waste).  All identifying information about you  and the linking code for the samples and /or results will be kept in locked files, in a locked building.   However, we will still be able to identify you if we need to for research reasons.

doctor. ************************************************************************************* 1. information on the research why are you being asked to take part in this research you are being asked to participate in this research study because you have been diagnosed with susac syndrome (sus). why is this study being done the primary purpose of this study is to collect detailed clinical information on as many patients (past, present, and future) with sus as possible, from around the world. the information collected includes ccf irb #: 13-188 approval date: 3/7/2015 expiration date: 3/6/2016 information about initial symptoms, the course of the disease, response to treatment, eventual outcome, and the impact the disease has had on patient s lives and family members. analysis of this information will help us to better understand this disease and to provide better care for current and future patients with sus. how many people will take part in the study about 150 people, from all over the world, will take part in this study, which is being conducted by the susac syndrome team at cleveland clinic. what is involved in the study there are two main components to the ics the international disease registry (idr) and the comprehensive database project (cdp): international disease registry (idr): the idr collects very limited basic information on as many patients as possible from around the world. this basic information is limited to the following: o patient s age at time of disease onset o patient s age at the time of diagnosis o patient s gender o patient s current country of residence o patient s home country o ethnicity of patient s parents o which of the following did the patient s sus involve: brain eyes ears a specific short idr form has been developed to capture the above information on a participating patient. the patient (or family) completes the form as best they can and sends it to dr. rennebohm. after receiving the idr form, dr. rennebohm attaches an anonymous code number to it, and enters it into the registry (idr). (based on future information he receives from the patient, dr. rennebohm will verify the information the patient has entered on the idr form and add any missing information.) no patient identifying information is entered into the registry. only dr. rennebohm will know the name of the patient associated with the code number. please see the idr research information sheet for more details. the idr requires minimal time, effort, and commitment on the part of the patient and no effort on the part of the patient s physician. it is anticipated that some patients may want to participate only in this component of the ics. the comprehensive database project (cdp): compared to the idr, this project is designed to collect much more extensive and detailed information and requires more time, effort, and commitment on the part of the patient. patients and family members will be asked to periodically complete data collection forms, most of which are self report questionnaires. these forms are designed to document how you were doing at the onset of your sus, how your illness changed once you were started on the medications prescribed by your personal physician, how you were doing at your last visit with your physician, and how you are doing now. in addition to being asked to complete forms, you may be contacted (by dr. rennebohm version date: v2, 24oct14 page 2 of 7 ccf irb #: 13-188 approval date: 3/7/2015 expiration date: 3/6/2016 and/or his research staff, via email or phone) to discuss other aspects of your experience with sus e.g. how it has affected your life, what medications seemed most valuable to you, how you think care for sus can be improved, etc. by reviewing other information the patient has sent (e.g. a cd of mri studies), dr. rennebohm (and/or his research team at cleveland clinic) will complete other data collection forms regarding your experience with sus. please see our cleveland clinic educational website on susac syndrome (google: clevelandclinic.org/susac) for more information about sub projects of the comprehensive database project. patients may participate in this project at whatever level they would like from minimum participation in only one sub project, to maximum participation in all sub projects. the patient chooses their level of commitment, and this level can change as they see fit. patients will need to sign this patient consent form (the one you are now reading) before participating in either of the above components of the ics. this patient consent form allows you to clearly indicate whether you are consenting to participate in the idr only or in the idr and the comprehensive database project. (please see the two boxes at the end of this form and check one or the other.) for participation in either component, you will be asked to send relevant parts of your medical records to dr. rennebohm. this may include copies of your physicians notes and dictations, hospitalization summaries, a cd containing your actual mri images, ophthalmology reports and images, and audiograms. once received, these records will be de identified, kept confidential and kept under lock and key. before patients send these medical records to dr. rennebohm, they will need to sign a release of medical records form one provided by cleveland clinic and one provided by their home physicians (for your home physicians purposes). this study does not involve testing of new treatments. it is not a clinical trial. the cleveland clinic educational website on susac syndrome, which is associated with the study, provides you and your personal physician with an up to date review of various treatment options for susac syndrome, including suggested guidelines for the treatment and long term management of sus all for you and your personal physician s consideration. you and your personal physician will decide on your own, however, how you would like to have your personal case of susac syndrome treated. enrollment and continued participation in the study may occur regardless of treatment decisions made by you and your personal physician. you may drop out of the study at any time. our cleveland clinic educational website on susac syndrome fully explains the ics, provides educational materials about sus, facilitates enrollment of patients from around the world, and provides a uniform set of disease assessment forms. patients, as well as physicians who are caring for (or have cared for) patients with sus, will be able to access the sus website for treatment and management guidelines, for the specific set of uniform data collection forms and disease assessment questionnaires, and for directions for participation in the ics. these forms and instruments, which may be downloaded from the website, were initially designed to help physicians during the day to day care of their patient with sus, but will now also be employed to facilitate data collection for research purposes. a key strategy of the ics is to enable, empower, and enlist patients to efficiently provide quality data about their experiences with sus i.e. this is a patient driven study, in which patients serve as patient researchers, for the sake of future patients. bio bank projects: version date: v2, 24oct14 page 3 of 7 ccf irb #: 13-188 approval date: 3/7/2015 expiration date: 3/6/2016 in addition to studying clinical aspects of susac syndrome, a third component of the ics is the collection of research samples for the analysis of novel biomarkers that may potentially aid in either the diagnosis of susac syndrome or in assessment of disease activity. we may be asking to do a blood draw (about 4 tablespoons) for biomarker analysis, and ask your permission to store any unused csf from clinical samples for future analysis. specimens will be collected and processed into either 0.5 ml or 1.0 ml aliquots, boxed, and stored in a minus 70 degree c freezer on site. funding will be supported by the fasenmyer center, directed by dr. calabrese. you will not have any biopsy or other procedures done specifically for the purpose of this study aside from blood collection as this collection is being done solely for research purposes. however, if you do have, or have had, a procedure such as a biopsy done, we are requesting that you allow us to use excess tissue which would otherwise be thrown away (surgical waste). all identifying information about you and the linking code for the samples and /or results will be kept in locked files, in a locked building. however, we will still be able to identify you if we need to for research reasons. please read the following statements and mark your choice: by checking the boxes below, indicate your choice regarding the use of your biopsy material and blood to be used for future research on ss after removal of your personal identifying information yes, i agree for my biopsy material and blood to be stored and used for research purposes. please initial here: date: no i do not agree for my biopsy material and blood to be stored for research purposes. please initial here: date: how long will you be in the study your participation in this study may last as long or as short as you wish. for those who are willing, it will last up to 10 years. 2. risks and discomforts what are the risks of the study there are no physical risks associated with this study. there is, however, the potential risk of loss of confidentiality. every effort will be made to keep your information confidential, however, this can not be guaranteed. some of the questions we will ask you as part of this study may make you feel uncomfortable. you may refuse to answer any of the questions and you may take a break at any time during the study. 3. benefits are there benefits to taking part in the study there is no personal benefit to you by participating in this research study. the knowledge to be gained from this research may be beneficial for other patients, society or science. version date: v2, 24oct14 page 4 of 7 ccf irb #: 13-188 approval date: 3/7/2015 expiration date: 3/6/2016 4. alternatives what other options are there participation in this study is strictly voluntary. the alternative is not to participate. 5. privacy and confidentiality the medical and research information recorded about you for this research will be used within the cleveland clinic and/or disclosed outside the cleveland clinic. tests and procedures done solely for this research study may be placed in your medical record to indicate your participation in this study. the information recorded about you as part of this research will be maintained in a confidential manner. upon completion of the study, you may have access to the research information if contained in the medical record. during the study, your access to research information about you will be limited. preventing this access

PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY  2.1 Study purpose:  We would like to collect normal tissue samples from various areas of the head and neck region to be  used in comparative studies with tumorous tissue already collected from patients who are being treated for cancers of the head and neck. In addition, we would like to collect a one-time blood sample and a one-time saliva sample. These samples will allow us to identify characteristics that are unique in  patients with a head and neck cancer from those that are found in tissues of the head and neck that are free from disease.  In addition, we would like to collect saliva samples from people who do not have head and neck cancer, particularly family members, to be used in comparative studies with saliva already collected from  patients who are being treated for cancers of the head and neck.  3. INFORMATION ABOUT STUDY PARTICIPANTS (SUBJECTS)  Taking part in this study is completely voluntary. You do not have to participate if you don't want to.  You may also leave the study at any time. If you leave the study before it is finished, there will be no penalty to you, and you will not lose any benefits to which you are otherwise entitled.  3.1 Who can take part in this study? Anyone who is undergoing a surgical treatment for a non-  cancerous condition in the head and neck region or is currently free of head and neck cancer. You will be eligible to participate if you are at least 18 years old. You must sign this Informed Consent document and have no barriers that would restrict your ability to understand or comply with all procedures.  3.2 How many people (subjects) are expected to take part in this study?  We anticipate studying at least 100 normal people.  Consent Subtitle: ____Normals____________  Page 2 of 10  Consent Version: __01/23/2013___________      Study ID: HUM00042189 IRB: IRBMED Date Approved: 2/11/2013 Expiration Date: 4/15/2013  4. INFORMATION ABOUT STUDY PARTICIPATION  4.1 What will happen to me in this study? If you participate in this study, all specimen  collections would be planned at the time of your normal treatment. During your clinic visit you will be asked to spit into a cup in order to collect a sample of your saliva. During your regularly  planned surgical procedure, we would simply collect a portion the tissue that is removed and store it in our specimen bank for use in future studies. Normally such tissue is thrown away, but with your  permission we can save this tissue for comparison to tumor tissue collected from other individuals.  We would also plan to draw your blood sample at this time while you are under anesthetic in order  to minimize discomfort. Approximately one and a half ounces of blood (approximately 3  tablespoons) will be collected. You will not be told the results of any testing on your specimens.  We would also like to collect basic information from you including your age at time of surgical  procedure, personal or family history of cancer, and health behavior information including history of smoking and alcohol use.  4.2 How much of my time will be needed to take part in this study? You will not need to  devote any additional time to this study.  4.3 When will my participation in the study be over? Your participation in the study will be  concluded after initial samples and clinical data are collected.  5. INFORMATION ABOUT RISKS AND BENEFITS  5.1 What risks will I face by taking part in the study? What will the researchers do to  protect me against these risks?  There are few foreseeable risks to you from participating in this study. When giving blood there is  potential for minor risks such as bruising, lightheadedness or fainting from blood sample collection.  We will work to reduce these risks by having only experienced people perform blood drawing and only  an experienced surgeon will perform your surgical procedure. The potential risks of your specific  surgical procedure are outlined in a separate consent document pertaining to that procedure specifically.  There are no risks to donating a saliva sample.  The researchers will try to minimize these risks by: Only experienced nurses or phlebotomists will  draw blood samples, and only an experienced surgeon will be performing your surgical procedure  during which tissue is collected.  There is a potential risk of loss or breach of confidentiality; however, patient confidentiality is a priority and we work hard to keep your personal and medical information private. See section 9 below for more information.  As with any research study, there may be additional risks that are unknown or unexpected.  Consent Subtitle: ____Normals____________  Page 3 of 10  Consent Version: __01/23/2013___________      Study ID: HUM00042189 IRB: IRBMED Date Approved: 2/11/2013 Expiration Date: 4/15/2013  5.2 What happens if I get hurt, become sick, or have other problems as a result of this  research?  The researchers have taken steps to minimize the risks of this study. Even so, you may still have  problems or side effects, even when the researchers are careful to avoid them. Please tell the researchers listed in Section 10 about any injuries, side effects, or other problems that you have during this study.  You should also tell your regular doctors.  5.3 If I take part in this study, can I also participate in other studies?  Being in more than one research study at the same time, or even at different times, may increase the risks to you. It may also affect the results of the studies. You should not take part in more than one study without approval from the researchers involved in each study.  5.4 How could I benefit if I take part in this study? How could others benefit?  You will not directly benefit from participation in this study. The potential benefit exists for those who in the future may be able to receive more effective and less damaging treatment for their cancers as a result of this study and others.  5.5 Will the researchers tell me if they learn of new information that could change my  willingness to stay in this study?  Yes, the researchers will tell you if they learn of important new information that may change your  willingness to participate in this study. If new information is provided to you after you have joined the study, it is possible that you may be asked to sign a new consent form that includes the new information.  6. OTHER OPTIONS  6.1 If I decide not to take part in this study, what other options do I have?  You may decide not to participate in this study. Your decision will not affect your medical  treatment in any way.  7. ENDING THE STUDY  7.1 If I want to stop participating in the study, what should I do?  If you decide to leave the study before it is finished, please tell one of the persons listed in Section 10  “Contact Information” (below). If you decide to leave the study after specimen has already been  collected and entered into our database, we may not be able to withdraw your specimen since no  Consent Subtitle: ____Normals____________  Page 4 of 10  Consent Version: __01/23/2013___________      Study ID: HUM00042189 IRB: IRBMED Date Approved: 2/11/2013 Expiration Date: 4/15/2013  personal identifiers will be entered that would allow us to determine which specimen in our data bank is from you.  7.2 Could there be any harm to me if I decide to leave the study before it is finished?  No, you can withdraw from this study at any time without harm.  7.3 Could the researchers take me out of the study even if I want to continue to  participate?  Yes. There are many reasons why the researchers may need to end your participation in the study. Some examples are:   The researcher believes that it is not in your best interest to stay in the study.   You become ineligible to participate.   Your condition changes and you need treatment that is not allowed while you are taking part in  the study.   You do not follow instructions from the researchers.   The study is suspended or canceled.  8. FINANCIAL INFORMATION  8.1 Who will pay for the costs of the study? Will I or my health plan be billed for any  costs of the study?

CONFIDENTIALITY OF SUBJECT RECORDS AND AUTHORIZATION TO RELEASE  YOUR PROTECTED HEALTH INFORMATION  The information below describes how your privacy and the confidentiality of your research records will be protected in this study.  9.1 How will the researchers protect my privacy?  Patient confidentiality is a top priority. You will be assigned a unique study number with which  your tissue, serum and saliva specimens will be identified. We shall put the information  collected about you during the study into a computerized research record. Your name and  identifying information will be kept in this record, but the only individuals with access to this  information are the study coordinators and laboratory technicians who are entering data or  specimens linked to your record. Your record will be assigned a unique code by our database  which will be used to link your treatment data with the data obtained from analysis of your  specimens. Specimens will be barcoded. We shall keep your research record confidential as  required by law and institutional policy. We shall not allow anyone to see your record other than  people who have a right to see it. You will not be individually identified in any reports of this  study. In order to understand the significance of the research done on your tissue, researchers  may need to know some things about you. For example, your gender, your age, your health  history and your family history. The information from your medical records will be given to  approved researchers by the Tissue Bank records staff. Information that directly identifies you  will not be shared with investigators other than those involved in this study.  Investigators involved in this program will be able to withdraw specimens or data from the tissue  repository as required by their individual projects. Investigators not involved in this program  must secure an appropriate Institutional Review Board (ethics board) approval in order to be  permitted access to specimens; bar-coded specimens will be distributed and any data provided  will have all personal identifying information removed.

collect normal tissue samples from various areas of the head and neck region to be used in comparative studies with tumorous tissue already collected from patients who are being treated for cancers of the head and neck. in addition, we would like to collect a one-time blood sample and a one-time saliva sample. these samples will allow us to identify characteristics that are unique in patients with a head and neck cancer from those that are found in tissues of the head and neck that are free from disease. in addition, we would like to collect saliva samples from people who do not have head and neck cancer, particularly family members, to be used in comparative studies with saliva already collected from patients who are being treated for cancers of the head and neck. 3. information about study participants (subjects) taking part in this study is completely voluntary. you do not have to participate if you don't want to. you may also leave the study at any time. if you leave the study before it is finished, there will be no penalty to you, and you will not lose any benefits to which you are otherwise entitled. 3.1 who can take part in this study anyone who is undergoing a surgical treatment for a non- cancerous condition in the head and neck region or is currently free of head and neck cancer. you will be eligible to participate if you are at least 18 years old. you must sign this informed consent document and have no barriers that would restrict your ability to understand or comply with all procedures. 3.2 how many people (subjects) are expected to take part in this study we anticipate studying at least 100 normal people. consent subtitle: normals page 2 of 10 consent version: 01/23/2013 study id: hum00042189 irb: irbmed date approved: 2/11/2013 expiration date: 4/15/2013 4. information about study participation 4.1 what will happen to me in this study if you participate in this study, all specimen collections would be planned at the time of your normal treatment. during your clinic visit you will be asked to spit into a cup in order to collect a sample of your saliva. during your regularly planned surgical procedure, we would simply collect a portion the tissue that is removed and store it in our specimen bank for use in future studies. normally such tissue is thrown away, but with your permission we can save this tissue for comparison to tumor tissue collected from other individuals. we would also plan to draw your blood sample at this time while you are under anesthetic in order to minimize discomfort. approximately one and a half ounces of blood (approximately 3 tablespoons) will be collected. you will not be told the results of any testing on your specimens. we would also like to collect basic information from you including your age at time of surgical procedure, personal or family history of cancer, and health behavior information including history of smoking and alcohol use. 4.2 how much of my time will be needed to take part in this study you will not need to devote any additional time to this study. 4.3 when will my participation in the study be over your participation in the study will be concluded after initial samples and clinical data are collected. 5. information about risks and benefits 5.1 what risks will i face by taking part in the study what will the researchers do to protect me against these risks there are few foreseeable risks to you from participating in this study. when giving blood there is potential for minor risks such as bruising, lightheadedness or fainting from blood sample collection. we will work to reduce these risks by having only experienced people perform blood drawing and only an experienced surgeon will perform your surgical procedure. the potential risks of your specific surgical procedure are outlined in a separate consent document pertaining to that procedure specifically. there are no risks to donating a saliva sample. the researchers will try to minimize these risks by: only experienced nurses or phlebotomists will draw blood samples, and only an experienced surgeon will be performing your surgical procedure during which tissue is collected. there is a potential risk of loss or breach of confidentiality; however, patient confidentiality is a priority and we work hard to keep your personal and medical information private. see section 9 below for more information. as with any research study, there may be additional risks that are unknown or unexpected. consent subtitle: normals page 3 of 10 consent version: 01/23/2013 study id: hum00042189 irb: irbmed date approved: 2/11/2013 expiration date: 4/15/2013 5.2 what happens if i get hurt, become sick, or have other problems as a result of this research the researchers have taken steps to minimize the risks of this study. even so, you may still have problems or side effects, even when the researchers are careful to avoid them. please tell the researchers listed in section 10 about any injuries, side effects, or other problems that you have during this study. you should also tell your regular doctors. 5.3 if i take part in this study, can i also participate in other studies being in more than one research study at the same time, or even at different times, may increase the risks to you. it may also affect the results of the studies. you should not take part in more than one study without approval from the researchers involved in each study. 5.4 how could i benefit if i take part in this study how could others benefit you will not directly benefit from participation in this study. the potential benefit exists for those who in the future may be able to receive more effective and less damaging treatment for their cancers as a result of this study and others. 5.5 will the researchers tell me if they learn of new information that could change my willingness to stay in this study yes, the researchers will tell you if they learn of important new information that may change your willingness to participate in this study. if new information is provided to you after you have joined the study, it is possible that you may be asked to sign a new consent form that includes the new information. 6. other options 6.1 if i decide not to take part in this study, what other options do i have you may decide not to participate in this study. your decision will not affect your medical treatment in any way. 7. ending the study 7.1 if i want to stop participating in the study, what should i do if you decide to leave the study before it is finished, please tell one of the persons listed in section 10 contact information (below). if you decide to leave the study after specimen has already been collected and entered into our database, we may not be able to

2019-05-13,../data//SCAN Informed Consent - 3.10.2013,../data//SCAN Informed Consent - 3.10.2013.txt,"﻿Medical University of South Carolina CONSENT TO BE A RESEARCH SUBJECT Bioactive sphingolipids in circulating exosomes in relation to the NMSC cancer-prone phenotype - SCAN Study  A. PURPOSE AND BACKGROUND: You are being asked to volunteer for a research study. The purpose of this study is to better understand what causes skin cancer, and how skin cancer relates to other types of cancer. For this study, we are asking both people who have had skin cancer and those who have never had skin cancer to participate. To study this, we will compare three groups of people who have appointments at the MUSC Dermatology Clinic.  The first group will include participants who have had skin cancer and another type of cancer. The second group will include participants who have had skin cancer and no history of other types of cancer. The third group will include participants who have not had any history of cancer. You are being asked to participate in this research because you are eligible for one of the three groups being studied. We will study what factors may be related to the development of nonmelanoma skin cancer and other types of cancer.   This research is sponsored by the Medical University of South Carolina. The investigator in charge of this study is Dr. Anthony Alberg. This study is being done at the Medical University of South Carolina and will involve approximately 170 volunteers.   B. PROCEDURES: If you agree to be in this study, the following will happen:  One-Time Study Visit:  If you choose to participate in this study the procedures described below will be done as part of the study visit and not as part of your routine care. At the study appointment:  * You will be asked to complete a survey that asks about factors that could affect a person's risk of cancer. These factors include questions about your demographics (such as age and gender), lifestyle factors (such as diet and sun exposure), general health and medical history. This survey will take about 20 minutes to complete.  * You will be asked to provide a blood sample by permitting a study team member to draw 14 mL of your blood (about 1 tablespoon). * After the completion of the consent process this appointment will take about 30 minutes, which includes the time it will take to complete the survey and the blood sample collection. Medical Record Review:  Your medical records will be reviewed to gather information about your general health not obtained from the questionnaire.  Information will be collected about the type of cancer, type of treatment received, and treatment outcomes of participants who have had skin cancer or another type of cancer.  Obtaining Data on Treatment Received and Cancer Treatment Outcomes: The Cancer Registry is the public health agency in South Carolina that is responsible for recording information about cancer cases in the state. Your information may be sent to the South Carolina Central Cancer Registry (SCCCR) to verify your history of cancer.  If you have ever had cancer, we will request information from the South Carolina Central Cancer Registry about the type of cancer diagnosis and treatment you receive(d).   Maintenance of Biological Samples: We will use the blood sample you provide to look for components that may be associated with skin cancer and other types of cancer. We plan to conduct laboratory tests after we collect these samples. The blood sample storage and laboratory tests we conduct for the SCAN study will take place on the MUSC campus.  We also plan to store a portion of your blood samples indefinitely in the MUSC Biomedical Bank for future studies not related to the SCAN study. Genetic information (DNA) may be extracted from the blood samples and stored. This biobank works in a way that is sensitive to your confidential information. Your name and any other information that directly identifies you will be removed from any specimen containers. The information about your identity will be replaced with a coded number. A list that links the coded number to your name, medical record number and the date and time the sample was collected will be kept in a locked, secure location.  This information will only be known to people who are a part of this research study, the biobank staff, and to future researchers if approved for use by a review board that protects people in research. Your blood samples will be stored with this coded number so that it can be used to document that the sample came from you and can be used to link the samples to your medical record information. If you want to withdraw your samples, you must do so in writing to the investigator.   The investigator's address is: Dr. Anthony Alberg  Department of Public Health Sciences Medical University of South Carolina 68 President Street, BEB 103-S Charleston, SC 29425  C. DURATION: Participation in the study will require attending one study visit that will last about 30 minutes. Your study participation begins when you sign this consent form.  After your study visit, we will then review your medical records and perform laboratory tests on your stored blood samples.   You may be contacted in the future to request additional information or to invite you to participate in a future study.   D. RISKS/DISCOMFORTS:  A. Loss of confidentiality: Because this study involves the collection of identifiable data, a potential risk is the loss of confidentiality. This means that you could be identified from the study information. To protect against this risk, a study ID number will be used in the study dataset instead of your name and identifiable information so that your study information is not in the same place as information that identifies you. So that we can link the various types of information collected in the study, we will keep a master list that contains your study ID, medical record number and name. This master list is kept separate from the study data.  The master list will be secured in a locked and secure place or on a password protected MUSC network drive.  B. Venipuncture: The risks of drawing blood include temporary discomfort from the needle stick, bruising and infection. Fainting could occur.  C. Genetic Research: Research to identify genes that cause or contribute to a disease or trait is an increasingly important way to try to understand the role of genes in human disease. You have been given this consent form because the Medical University of South Carolina investigators want to include your blood sample in a research project, or because they want to save such biological samples for future research. There are several things you should know before allowing your cells and blood to be studied or to be stored.   1. Your blood sample will be stored under your name or some other type of identifier which could be linked to you.  Sometimes these samples are shared for research purposes with other investigators at other research sites.  If this is done, the other investigators would not know your name. 2. In addition to your name, other information about you might be connected to your blood sample. For instance, information about race, ethnicity, sex, your medical history, and so forth might be available to investigators studying your blood. Such information is important for scientific reasons and sometimes for public health. It is possible that genetic information might come to be associated with your racial or ethnic group. 3. Genetic information about you will often apply (in one degree or another) to family members. It is not generally the University's policy to provide genetic information about you to your family members. However, certain studies, called ""pedigree studies"", share such information among family members. For this and related research you will be asked if you are willing to share your genetic information with your family members. 4. You have the right to refuse to allow your tissue or blood to be studied or saved for future research studies. You may withdraw from this study at any time and remove any samples that contain identifiers from research use after the date of your withdrawal. This means that while the University might retain the identified samples-the law often requires this-they would not be used for research. 5. South Carolina law mandates that your genetic information obtained from any tests or from this research, be kept confidential. Our state law prohibits any insurer using this information in a discriminatory manner against you or any member of your family in issuing or renewing insurance coverage for you or your family. Our state law further prohibits our sharing your genetic information with anyone except in a few narrow circumstances, one of these being a research project of this type, approved by the Institutional Review Board and then we must take all steps to protect your identity. You will still be responsible for paying for health care, however. The Medical University of South Carolina will not be responsible for such costs, even if care is needed for a condition revealed during research or clinical testing. 6. Genetic research raises difficult questions about informing you and other subjects of any results, or of future results. Some people feel anxious about the possibility of having a defective gene that would place them or their children at risk. Some people want to know what is found out about them; others do not. The risks of knowing include anxiety and other psychological distress. The risks of not knowing what is found include not being aware if there is treatment for the problem being studied. But these risks can change depending on whether there is a treatment or cure for a particular disease, and on how clear the results are. If there is a medical reason to seek specific information from you, your doctor will tell you this. A process called ""genetic counseling"" is often appropriate in such cases; you should ask your doctor or nurse about this if you have any questions. Investigators in this study may try to recontact you in the future to find out about your health. If you are recontacted and want to know what the investigators have learned about your samples, you should understand that the following are the kinds of things the investigators or your health team might tell you: a) Information is too sketchy to give you particular details, but you will receive a newsletter informing you about the results of the project.       b) You carry a gene for a particular disease that can be treated. c) You can carry a gene for a particular disease for which there is no current treatment. This news might cause severe anxiety or other psychological distress, depending on the severity of the disease. d) You carry a gene for a disease and might consider informing relatives that they, too, might carry the gene. It can be very difficult to decide whether to share such information with relatives. Genetic counselors can help sort out the various options in such a case. Also, for any future research, we may contact you with a new consent form giving you additional information. Are you willing to be recontacted in the future regarding this research study, future research opportunities and/or your samples?  Please initial your selection. ______ Yes		______ No  7. If you are concerned about a potential genetic disorder, you and your doctor might choose to test specifically for it. This would require additional blood or tissue samples and would not be part of this research project. You should discuss this option with your doctor or genetic counselor. 8. The presence of a genetic marker does not necessarily mean that an individual will develop a disease. Informing people of all such markers independently of medical need can cause unnecessary anxiety. On the other hand, the absence of a marker does not mean that someone will not get the disease. Genetic diseases appear as a result of a complex mixture of hereditary, environmental, behavioral and other factors. These are the best-known risks and challenges of genetic research. There might be other risks we do not know about yet. It is important that you talk to your doctor, nurse or genetic counselor if you have questions or concerns about the research study. E. RELEASE OF MEDICAL RECORDS The MUSC medical record databases will be the first source of medical record data.  In instances where patient information about cancer history is available only by accessing medical information contained at another medical care provider, the participant will be asked for permission to obtain cancer history information from the other medical facility. The study research team will then send a medical record request signed by the participant to the other facility to ask to obtain information about the patient's cancer history. F.

university of south carolina consent to be a research subject bioactive sphingolipids in circulating exosomes in relation to the nmsc cancer-prone phenotype - scan study a. purpose and background: you are being asked to volunteer for a research study. the purpose of this study is to better understand what causes skin cancer, and how skin cancer relates to other types of cancer. for this study, we are asking both people who have had skin cancer and those who have never had skin cancer to participate. to study this, we will compare three groups of people who have appointments at the musc dermatology clinic. the first group will include participants who have had skin cancer and another type of cancer. the second group will include participants who have had skin cancer and no history of other types of cancer. the third group will include participants who have not had any history of cancer. you are being asked to participate in this research because you are eligible for one of the three groups being studied. we will study what factors may be related to the development of nonmelanoma skin cancer and other types of cancer. this research is sponsored by the medical university of south carolina. the investigator in charge of this study is dr. anthony alberg. this study is being done at the medical university of south carolina and will involve approximately 170 volunteers. b. procedures: if you agree to be in this study, the following will happen: one-time study visit: if you choose to participate in this study the procedures described below will be done as part of the study visit and not as part of your routine care. at the study appointment: * you will be asked to complete a survey that asks about factors that could affect a person's risk of cancer. these factors include questions about your demographics (such as age and gender), lifestyle factors (such as diet and sun exposure), general health and medical history. this survey will take about 20 minutes to complete. * you will be asked to provide a blood sample by permitting a study team member to draw 14 ml of your blood (about 1 tablespoon). * after the completion of the consent process this appointment will take about 30 minutes, which includes the time it will take to complete the survey and the blood sample collection. medical record review: your medical records will be reviewed to gather information about your general health not obtained from the questionnaire. information will be collected about the type of cancer, type of treatment received, and treatment outcomes of participants who have had skin cancer or another type of cancer. obtaining data on treatment received and cancer treatment outcomes: the cancer registry is the public health agency in south carolina that is responsible for recording information about cancer cases in the state. your information may be sent to the south carolina central cancer registry (scccr) to verify your history of cancer. if you have ever had cancer, we will request information from the south carolina central cancer registry about the type of cancer diagnosis and treatment you receive(d). maintenance of biological samples: we will use the blood sample you provide to look for components that may be associated with skin cancer and other types of cancer. we plan to conduct laboratory tests after we collect these samples. the blood sample storage and laboratory tests we conduct for the scan study will take place on the musc campus. we also plan to store a portion of your blood samples indefinitely in the musc biomedical bank for future studies not related to the scan study. genetic information (dna) may be extracted from the blood samples and stored. this biobank works in a way that is sensitive to your confidential information. your name and any other information that directly identifies you will be removed from any specimen containers. the information about your identity will be replaced with a coded number. a list that links the coded number to your name, medical record number and the date and time the sample was collected will be kept in a locked, secure location. this information will only be known to people who are a part of this research study, the biobank staff, and to future researchers if approved for use by a review board that protects people in research. your blood samples will be stored with this coded number so that it can be used to document that the sample came from you and can be used to link the samples to your medical record information. if you want to withdraw your samples, you must do so in writing to the investigator. the investigator's address is: dr. anthony alberg department of public health sciences medical university of south carolina 68 president street, beb 103-s charleston, sc 29425 c. duration: participation in the study will require attending one study visit that will last about 30 minutes. your study participation begins when you sign this consent form. after your study visit, we will then review your medical records and perform laboratory tests on your stored blood samples. you may be contacted in the future to request additional information or to invite you to participate in a future study. d. risks/discomforts: a. loss of confidentiality: because this study involves the collection of identifiable data, a potential risk is the loss of confidentiality. this means that you could be identified from the study information. to protect against this risk, a study id number will be used in the study dataset instead of your name and identifiable information so that your study information is not in the same place as information that identifies you. so that we can link the various types of information collected in the study, we will keep a master list that contains your study id, medical record number and name. this master list is kept separate from the study data. the master list will be secured in a locked and secure place or on a password protected musc network drive. b. venipuncture: the risks of drawing blood include temporary discomfort from the needle stick, bruising and infection. fainting could occur. c. genetic research: research to identify genes that cause or contribute to a disease or trait is an increasingly important way to try to understand the role of genes in human disease. you have been given this consent form because the medical university of south carolina investigators want to include your blood sample in a research project, or because they want to save such biological samples for future research. there are several things you should know before allowing your cells and blood to be studied or to be stored. 1. your blood sample will be stored under your name or some other type of identifier which could be linked to you. sometimes these samples are shared for research purposes with other investigators at other research sites. if this is done, the other investigators would not know your name. 2. in addition to your name, other information about you might be connected to your blood sample. for instance, information about race, ethnicity, sex, your medical history, and so forth might be available to investigators studying your blood. such information is important for scientific reasons and sometimes for public health. it is possible that genetic information might come to be associated with your racial or ethnic group. 3. genetic information about you will often apply (in one degree or another) to family members. it is not generally the university's policy to provide genetic information about you to your family members. however, certain studies, called ""pedigree studies"", share such information among family members. for this and related research you will be asked if you are willing to share your genetic information with your family members. 4. you have the right to refuse to allow your tissue or blood to be studied or saved for future research studies. you may withdraw from this study at any time and remove any samples that contain identifiers from research use after the date of your withdrawal. this means that while the university might retain the identified samples-the law often requires this-they would not be used for research. 5. south carolina law mandates that your genetic information obtained from any tests or from this research, be kept confidential. our state law prohibits any insurer using this information in a discriminatory manner against you or any member of your family in issuing or renewing insurance coverage for you or your family. our state law further prohibits our sharing your genetic information with anyone except in a few narrow circumstances, one of these being a research project of this type, approved by the institutional review board and then we must take all steps to protect your identity. you will still be responsible for paying for health care, however. the medical university of south carolina will not be responsible for such costs, even if care is needed for a condition revealed during research or clinical testing. 6. genetic research raises difficult questions about informing you and other subjects of any results, or of future results. some people feel anxious about the possibility of having a defective gene that would place them or their children at risk. some people want to know what is found out about them; others do not. the risks of knowing include anxiety and other psychological distress. the risks of not knowing what is found include not being aware if there is treatment for the problem being studied. but these risks can change depending on whether there is a treatment or cure for a particular disease, and on how clear the results are. if there is a medical reason to seek specific information from you, your doctor will tell you this. a process called ""genetic counseling"" is often appropriate in such cases; you should ask your doctor or nurse about this if you have any questions. investigators in this study may try to recontact you in the future to find out about your health. if you are recontacted and want to know what the investigators have learned about your samples, you should understand that the following are the kinds of things the investigators or your health team might tell you: a) information is too sketchy to give you particular details, but you will receive a newsletter informing you about the results of the project. b) you carry a gene for a particular disease that can be treated. c) you can carry a gene for a particular disease for which there is no current treatment. this news might cause severe anxiety or other psychological distress, depending on the severity of the disease. d) you carry a gene for a disease and might consider informing relatives that they, too, might carry the gene. it can be very difficult to decide whether to share such information with relatives. genetic counselors can help sort out the various options in such a case. also, for any future research, we may contact you with a new consent form giving you additional information. are you willing to be recontacted in the future regarding this research study, future research opportunities and/or your samples please initial your selection.  yes		 no 7. if you are concerned about a potential genetic disorder, you and your doctor might choose to test specifically for it. this would require additional blood or tissue samples and would not be part of this research project. you should discuss this option with your doctor or genetic counselor. 8. the presence of a genetic marker does not necessarily mean that an individual will develop a disease. informing people of all such markers independently of medical need can cause unnecessary anxiety. on the other hand, the absence of a marker does not mean that someone will not get the disease. genetic diseases appear as a result of a complex mixture of hereditary, environmental, behavioral and other factors. these are the best-known risks and challenges of genetic research. there might be other risks we do not know about yet. it is important that you talk to your doctor, nurse or genetic counselor if you have questions or concerns about the research study. e. release of medical records the musc medical record databases will be the first source of medical record data. in instances where patient information about cancer history is available only by accessing medical information contained at another medical care provider, the participant will be asked for permission to obtain cancer history information from the other medical facility. the study research team will then send a medical record request signed by the participant to the other facility to ask to obtain information about the patient's cancer history. f. benefits: there will be no direct benefit to you from participating in this study. however, it is hoped that the information gained from the study will help investigators to better understand what factors are associated with skin cancer and other types of cancer. g. costs: you will not be charged for any of the study procedures. the costs of all tests associated with this study and the storage of your blood samples will be covered by the study. h. payment to participants: in return for your time, effort, and travel expenses, you will receive a $50 target gift certificate for participation in this study. if you receive $600 or more from musc (including cash, checks, gift cards or other gifts) during the calendar year, you will receive a tax form 1099 and the irs will be notified of the amount you received. i. alternatives: the alternative is that you choose not to participate in this study. your decision to participate in or opt out of this study will not affect your healthcare, medical treatment or health benefits in any way. j. student paragraph: your participation or discontinuance will not constitute an element of your academic performance nor will it be a part of your academic record at this institution. k. employee participation: your participation or discontinuance will not constitute an element of your job performance or evaluation nor will it be a part of your personnel record at this institution. l. results and publications: results of this research will be used for the purposes described in this
